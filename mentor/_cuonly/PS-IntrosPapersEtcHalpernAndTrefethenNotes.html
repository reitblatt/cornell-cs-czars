<h4 align=center> Nick Trefethen & Joe Halpern </h4>

This session was actually two shorter talks about writing. Notes for
both <A HREF="#lnt-talk">Nick Trefethen's 
discussion</A> and <A HREF="#halpern-talk">Joe Halpern's 
discussion</A> are available. <br>

<A NAME="lnt-talk"> 
<hr>
Trefethen prefaced his remarks by pointing out that he was going to 
talk about his personal experience as a writer and professor, rather than 
attempt to lecture on general principles. He presented several points
accompanied by humorous "grooks" by Piet Hein to illustrate those points. 
(To read the "grook" associated with certain remarks, click on the 
word GROOK whenever you see it.) <A HREF="#grook1">GROOK</A>
<p> 

<li> <em>"This talk is about me, not about general principles." </em><br>
 People will operate and do their work 
in very different ways. This talk will explain the way writing has 
fit into his life and some of his thoughts and observations about the 
process. 
<A HREF="#grook2">GROOK</A>
<p> 

<li> <em> "My writings are what I care most about in my life." </em><br> 
It could be suggested that life in academia is an attempt to escape
mortality by creating something interesting, perhaps timeless. What we
"leave behind" may be only our ideas, and, expressed well, these ideas
can last for a long time. To some, writing is more important than, for
example, teaching. Although, Trefethen acknowledges it would certainly
not be a good thing if everybody felt this way about their writings.
<A HREF="#grook3">GROOK</A> <p>

<li> <em> "I cannot distinguish writing and research." </em> <br> 
The process of writing is different for everyone. Trefethen's
preferred method is to work a bit, write a bit, work a bit, write
some more, etc. Thus, the writing goes through many iterations. His feeling
is that no one can truly think clearly except by writing, however he
admits that this is obviously not true. For him, though, it certainly
holds. He also observes that this tendency in himself has become more
extreme with the years.  <A HREF="#grook4">GROOK</A> <p>

<li> <em> "I polish every paper endlessly." </em> <br> 
For Trefethen, each paper goes through multiple iterations, he estimates
approximately 20, each of which consists of reading every 
word in the document. He made an analogy to fixed-point iteration, 
that is: Call the paper X, then Edit(X) should eventually be X itself again
(Edit(X) = X). He wryly cautioned that within this framework, being a student
of his can be deadly. 
<A HREF="#grook5">GROOK</A> 
<p> 


<li> <em> "I am obsessive about TeX and PostScript."  </em> <br> 

While discussing typesetting, he mentioned his fastidious concern over
fractions of a pt. in TeX, be it left, right, up or down, and also
several pet peeves such as underlining spaces in an HTML hyperlink,
using the correct umlauts and the distinction between en-dashes and
em-dashes in TeX.  The ultimate goal of this sort of attention to
detail is to make the typesetting so perfect that no imperfections
therein can distract the reader from the ideas being presented.  <A
HREF="#grook6">GROOK</A> <p>

<li> <em> "I can't rest till it's utterly simple and utterly clear." </em><br> 
Trefethen is more interested in explaining and expositing than 
creating, per se. He posits that each theorem has a Platonic 
proof ("God's proof, God's explanation") at least on a psychological
level if not philosophically. In his mind, <em> the </em> wrong proof is nearly
as bad as <em> a </em> wrong proof. However, he observes that this can 
be a risky course to take, especially in academia, where simplifying 
is somehow disrespected, and conversely making easy things hard is 
lauded. See "Dancing With Professors: The trouble with Academic Prose" by 
Patricia Nelson Limerick in the NYT Book Review. 
<A HREF="#grook7">GROOK</A> 
<p> 

<li> <em> "My papers are all equal, and all different."  </em> <br> 
He feels about his papers as parents arguably should about their
children. Virtually everything, especially in recent years is 
a new contribution. He avoids rehashings of already published 
material. He makes no distinction between proceedings and journals. 
He also mentioned that he finds the idea of "ranking" one's work
(refereed journals as distinguished from conferences as distinguished
from workshops, etc.) on a c.v. to be particularly repugnant. 
<A HREF="#grook8">GROOK</A>
<p> 


<li> <em> "I only work on problems I consider important."  </em> <br> 
He suggested that there is no point in working on something that doesn't
have impact, whether it be long-term or short-term. However, this 
takes confidence and experience, and he pointed out that early on 
on his career he was more narrowly technically focused. In short, being
bold is fun, 
<A HREF="#grook9">GROOK</A> 
<p> 


<li> <em> "Ignoring others' work is a crime."   </em> <br> 
Trefethen argues that papers with a sufficient number of references, 
and without good references are "intellectually reprehensible." A 
paper must be authoritative as well as creative. He drew a comparison between
academic fraud which is rare but receives lots of press and "cheating"
(working in an intellectual vacuum) which is ubiquitous, but gets very 
little attention. This can cause catastrophic results at worse, and
result in an extremely loss of efficiency at best, and yet it 
continues to happen. He suggests that the reason this hasn't stopped
is that readers tolerate it. 
<A HREF="#grook10">GROOK</A>
<p> 


<li> <em> "Not everybody is like me."  </em> <br> 
Trefethen acknowledges that he is fairly pathological in his obsession
about writing, and that not everyone will fit this pattern. There are
other ways to function. His focus on the vagaries of the English would
be very unusual coming from a non-native speaker. However, as English
is becoming the de facto international standard for scientific
discourse, his concerns about the quality of writing become more 
(arguably less, depending on one's perspective) urgent.

<A NAME="halpern-talk">
<hr>  

Joe Halpern discussed his "biased" view of writing a paper. He first
made the observation that the most important thing when writing a paper of 
any sort is the story. The story is not the main theorem of the paper or 
the system that's been built. Either of these will support the story line.
The story is what will convince readers that they want to read your paper. 
<p>

There are several ways of figuring out what exactly the story is. If
you write the abstract first (rather than finishing the paper and then 
coming up with an abstract) then you'll be forced to figure this out.
 Other methods include giving short
conference talks (20 minutes, 10 minutes) to people who can offer
constructive criticism.  If this isn't possible, then attempting to 
explain your results to friends, partners, even parents may help to 
clarify things.  Sometimes explaining things to people not well versed 
in the area will offer insights at a structural rather than technical 
level. 
<p>

Structuring the paper well, making it accessible and inviting and making 
sure that the story is clearly told will make it more likely that people 
will read your paper. A usual outline will include an introduction, 
definitions and background, technical results and a discussion/conclusion. 
<p>

The introduction is the most important part of the paper. This is
usually where people will decide whether or not to keep reading. Here,
you should present the big picture, suggest ways to formalize the
intuition behind the big picture, mention your results which back up
this intuition and also briefly discuss how your approach compares to
other approaches.  The reader should be able to read your introduction
and have a good, clear idea of what the paper is about. Be careful,
however, to make sure that the rest of the paper lives up to the
introduction. There is a fine line between honesty and <em> not </em>
downplaying your results. Halpern suggests that a good introduction is
similar to a good advertising campaign. Make people interested in your
product (the rest of the paper) but don't build up expectations that
cannot be met.
<p>

In a typical paper, the second section will give the necessary definitions
and background. The question here becomes: How much should you assume
that the reader knows? This will of course depend on the intended audience. 
However, even if the intended audience is expected to be fluent in the 
area, Halpern suggests it is always better to err on the side of including
more rather than less. This makes life easier for the reader and will 
avoid sentences such as: <em> Here we discuss X as defined in [1] and 
implement using the algorithm presented in [2] with the adaptations 
proposed in [3]. </em> 
<p>

The next few sections will include the technical results. Again, be sure
that the results presented here fulfill the promises of the introduction. 
Also, keep in mind the story you are trying to tell and make sure 
the results are consistent with that story. Often, the story may suggest
new results to prove or experiments to run.  Scholarliness is key. 
It is important to include a detailed comparison to or discussion of 
related work. Also be careful to separate things into coherent, meaningful
sections. 
<p>

The final section should wrap things up for the reader. Summarize the 
story again, suggest possible future research and applications, speculate
on the impact and remind the reader of the big picture. Mention once
again how the various pieces relate to the big picture and tie together
the loose ends.

Twin Mystery <br><br>
To many people artists seem <br>

Such laziness, with such great gifts, <br>

another, what they're doing with <br> 
their energy and time. <br>
