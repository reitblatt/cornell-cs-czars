    for information such as current salaries and number of Ph.D's produced per year. It
    also has a basic ranking of CS programs from a 1995 survey. However, if you
    care about that sort of thing, you should compare it to the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Tips from my own experience</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My husband, Steve Zdancewic and
    I recently completed a two-body job search, luckily with much success. We
    will both be starting at the University of Pennsylvania in
Fall 2002. We were both solely interested in tenure-track faculty positions at
research universities, and
our research areas had quite a bit of overlap.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are some of our observations to get the most out of the entire process:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have fun! You will meet interesting and friendly people, travel
    to many new places, and eat well.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remember to thank your host and
    anyone else who is particularly helpful.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Realize at the beginning that there is a lot of randomness involved. You
    will spend a lot of time trying to figure out a better algorithm for this
    process. Let me know if you come up with something.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For couples, there are a number of options for when to reveal
    the two-body problem.
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>In the cover letter.</i></font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>On the phone when one
            of you is invited to an interview.&nbsp;<br>
        </i>We did it this way. It's pretty awkward, and if I did it all over
        again, I would put it in the cover letter. However, it is reassuring
        to hear, "Oh, we had no idea you were married, but we were going to invite
        your spouse for interview too."&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Later, during the interview or after you have received an offer.<br>
        </i>Only if you are not applying to the same department. It might be
        a good idea to do so during the
        interview if your spouse is also an academic. Afterwards is fine if your
        spouse is not looking for a faculty position.&nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Myths about two body problems.&nbsp;
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>No school will hire two people in the same area.<br>
        </i>If a school is weak in your area, hiring two people is a good
        way to build it up quickly.&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Your best bet is two schools in the same place.<br>
        </i> We were very lucky and a lot of schools wanted to hire multiple
        people. Therefore we didn't have to worry about one of us "settling" for
        a less good school. If you look at a map, there aren't very many top
        schools geographically close to one another. Those
        that are may not be hiring in your area.&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Schools won't be able
            to make separate assessments of you.&nbsp;<br>
        </i> Be prepared for a school to be dramatically more enthusiastic about
        one of you than the other. While
        it is encouraging to know that you are being judged independently, it
        can be emotionally trying.&nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Go to the top conference in your area right before interviewing. Talk to
    people.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Talk to people at your school
    (including your advisor) about where you should apply.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Go ahead and talk to the "competition" --
      other people who are also interviewing. </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's good to talk to people who are doing the same thing as you are.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You might learn something important that you missed on your interview.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The schools gossip about you too.</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't dismiss a school just because
      you haven't heard much about it.&nbsp;Places without people in your area are
    some of your best opportunities.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While in grad school, go to as
      many hiring talks as you can. Some of the people you'll meet again on your
      interview. You'll also learn how to give a
    job talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Find out about the research going on at your own school, even if it is not
    in your area.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are excited by a school
  LET THEM KNOW.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Realize at the beginning that an interview is also a personality test.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For couples interviewing in the same department, there are a number of scheduling
    options:
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Two separate interviews that may be up to two months apart<br>
        </i>
        The advantage is timing: you won't have to worry about getting an early
        offer and being forced to make a decision before you have heard from
        other places. You also get a better chance to compare notes before the
        second person's interview. The disadvantages: it's hard on the school
        and it is easy for your spouse to completely color your experience.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Two separate back-to-back interviews<br>
        </i>
        If the two of you go together, one can scope out the town while the
        other interviews. I found this type to be the most fun -- you have
        your spouse there for support in the evening. However, it does take the most time as you may spend
        up to 5 days in a single place.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Two concurrent interviews<br>
        </i>
        This usually takes place over two days. One person gives a talk the
        first day, and the other the second. During both days you cross paths,
        as you meet with faculty one-on-one. The disadvantage is that one person
        may not get a
        standard seminar slot, so the talk will be sparsely attended. Also,
        the second person will have to talk to many people before the seminar,
        which is less ideal.</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Top five questions you will be asked on an interview. Don't leave home
    without answers to these. Luckily three of the answers are in your
    application materials.
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you have any questions? (See Tomorrow's Professor for a good supply
        of these.)</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What are you going to do next? (Even before asking about current
        work.)</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Describe your research to me in 5 minutes. (If you haven't given your
        talk yet.)</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How will you make your decision about where to go?</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What would you like to teach?&nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Go ahead and answer questions
      such as "Where else do you have
    interviews?" "Do you have any offers?"
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If they really want to know
      they can easily find out.&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's not a game to get the
        most offers you can, the goal is to get the one offer you want.&nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Questions that threw me off guard:
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Where do you get your inspiration? How do you do research?</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What will be the first thesis that you supervise?</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do you evaluate research
      in your area?&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isn't programming languages a dead field that hasn't produced anything
        worthwhile in the past 20 years?</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have an interview at MIT, practice the <a href="http://charliefrye.com/Tricks_2/tricks_2.shtml">Great
    Cork Escape</a>.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take this opportunity to ask
      people about being a professor. You'll be talking to a lot of people who
      do what you want to do. This is
    particularly useful if you want to find out how people balance work and
    family, deal with two bodies in the same department (it's actually quite
    common), or if there is some other specific concern you may have.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will get better at interviewing
      as the season progresses. Don't put the school you most care about first
    on your schedule.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will also get worn out during the interviews. If you are lucky enough
    to get many interviews you may consider not accepting or even canceling some
    of them. If you can stand it, it's good for you to go on as many as
    possible. (You meet more people that way.) Perhaps next year when I see the
    other side of faculty hiring, I'll find out whether schools want you to
    cancel right away if you think you wouldn't accept their offer, or want to
    have the chance to convince you to come.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ask for more time if you need it to make a decision. Take your time, and
    don't feel guilty if you do. Although it seems like everyone around wants
    you to decide as quickly as possible, it is your life. Second visits are a
    good idea.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Practicalities
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Buy a cell phone with a national plan.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hotels usually have dry cleaning service available. (Avoid desserts
        covered in powdered sugar.)</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have food preferences, tell your host or the administrative
        assistant that helps you with your travel plans. It's less awkward to
        tell them ahead of time than at the restaurant.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Interview schedules vary. Some are 1 full day, some two days with the
        possibility of leaving in the afternoon of the second day, some are two
        full days. Make sure you ask.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's probably not worth it
          to volunteer your seat to get a free ticket, even if you are flying
        home.&nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have fun! You will meet interesting and friendly people, travel
    to many new places, and eat well. I know I started with this one, but it
    bears repetition.</font></li>
