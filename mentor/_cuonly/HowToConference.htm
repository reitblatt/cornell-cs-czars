		#24 - How to get the most out of conferences </h2>
	  <p align="center">By <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/about/">Scott Berkun</a>, March 2003</p>
	  <p> <img style="width: 320px; height: 227px;" src="HowToConference_files/24-6.jpg" align="right" height="195" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="285">Conferences are what you make of them. If you&#8217;re not sure why you&#8217;re going, or what 
		you want to get out of the experience, you&#8217;re unlikely to get it. This essay gives one 
		perspective on conferences, and how to make them more valuable and engaging experiences. 
		I think in general professional conferences take a very conservative approach to training 
		and education, and it demands that attendees take more responsibility for getting value 
		from the experience than should be necessary. </p>
	  <p>(<a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/essay29.htm">Planning good conferences and training events</a> is a separate 
		topic. In short: Attention spans have plummeted in the last decade, yet most conference 
		formats haven&#8217;t changed at all. There are much better ways to train and teach people 
		through events).</p>
	  <h3>Conversations are more valuable than the sessions</h3>
	  <p>The surprising thing in my experience about most conferences is that the most interesting, 
		informative and educational moments are not spent in the sessions themselves: it&#8217;s in 
		all of the other interactions with peers from other companies and organizations. The 
		lectures, talks and panels might provide some useful approaches or ideas, but for the 
		most part, the slides and papers from those sessions can be obtained later. This is 
		not true for all of the unique, personal, and insightful conversations you might have 
		with other people. A special thing about a conference is the opportunity for those interactions. 
		Unless you work at a firm that specializes in the kind of job you have, much of your 
		time back at work is spent with people who do not have the same background and kinds 
		of interests that you do. </p>
	  <p>This means that you need to invest time in connecting with other people. It&#8217;s like 
		going to a party where you don&#8217;t know anyone except the host: You have to have some 
		strategy or plan for ensuring that you do not spend the entire time standing alone in 
		the corner, holding a beer, hoping someone will talk to you. If the conference is well 
		designed, there should be workshops or BOFs (bird of a feather) sessions, where smaller 
		groups meet for an afternoon or a full day, and talk about a specific subject of interest. 
		Often these are scheduled early in a conference, setting you up with a few people you 
		know and can talk to through the rest of the conference.</p>
	  <h3>How to spend your time</h3>
	  <p>Aside from finding ways to talk with other people and make some connections, it&#8217;s worth 
		thinking about the kinds of sessions that are typically available at a professional 
		conference. When I look at the advanced program for a conference, here's how I rank 
		the different kinds of sessions: </p>
	  <ol>
		<li><strong>Contributing to something</strong>:&nbsp; Most professional and academic 
		  conferences have a process for accepting material as part of the conference. Anyone 
		  can submit a paper, panel session idea, or workshop proposal. There is no better way 
		  to meet people and get access to the smartest and most interesting people at the conference 
		  than participating. Even the process of submitting something is rewarding: you&#8217;ll 
		  spend some time trying to express your work in a way that others can get value out 
		  of, which always improves your ability to think and communicate about what you do. 
		  Even if your submission isn&#8217;t accepted, you will have benefited. You&#8217;ll get feedback 
		  from the experts on the review committee about your work and your writing, which you 
		  could argue is a free service to you. No matter what happens, if you try to submit 
		  something, you&#8217;ll be better prepared for the process should you try to submit something 
		  the following year or to another conference. <br>
		</li><li><strong>Workshops</strong>: There is no substitute. It is the only organized forum 
		  for a small/mid sized group to spend serious time discussing one or more topics. The 
		  requirement for entry is usually a position statement, expressing your point of view 
		  on a subject, and your references supporting why you'd be a useful member of the workshop. 
		  These are consistently the most enlightening sessions, and give you the largest opportunity 
		  to meet and interact with intelligent people interested in a topic that you are interested 
		  in. Even in a bad (as in boring, poorly organized, or just plain frustrating) workshop, 
		  ask around for people who want to go out to dinner. Sometimes the conversation over 
		  dinner is better than the workshop (but the workshop gives you access to the right 
		  people to have an interesting dinner conversation with). <br>
		</li><li><strong>SIGs / BOFs </strong>: These tend to be loosely organized, and it's often 
		  hard to find out which ones there are. Basically these are informal workshops, called 
		  special interest groups or Birds of a feather sessions.&nbsp; Sometimes they're short 
		  meetings where people agree to create a new alias for discussion. Other times there 
		  is an agenda, with speakers, and it's like a mini-session. Anyone can start one of 
		  these by following the information listed in the advanced program. They'll help by 
		  giving you a room and a time. <br>
		</li><li><strong><img style="width: 278px; height: 204px;" alt="session in progress" src="HowToConference_files/24-9.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="225" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="300">Tutorials</strong> : These are half and full day sessions with an invited speaker. 
		  You typically have to pay extra to attend these. The sessions are&nbsp;often lecture 
		  based, focused on one specific topic or set of topics. If you need&nbsp;training on 
		  some aspect of your job, and can&#8217;t find it local to you, tutorials are great. However, 
		  the sessions are often large, and for popular topics or teachers, can be hard to get 
		  into. If you can, ask around about tutorials you&#8217;re interested in: given the expense 
		  involved, try to avoid taking tutorials blind without at least one reference on the 
		  quality of the teacher: different conferences have different standards so don&#8217;t depend 
		  on them to set the bar for you.<br>
		</li><li><strong>Panels</strong> : A panel session has 4 or 5 invited speakers sharing a 
		  time slot together. In better panel sessions, there is a diversity of points of view, 
		  and everyone is comfortable sharing them. But too often, panelists shy away from the 
		  intended topic, or avoid disagreeing with their co-panelists. They often feel pressure 
		  to represent their company or organization, which inhibits&nbsp;active and provocative 
		  discourse. This is why most panel sessions are pretty bland, and feel vaguely like 
		  a presidential debate where no one really seems to be saying anything. It&#8217;s up to 
		  the organizer to avoid making this happen, but since they&#8217;re grateful for the panelists 
		  to attend at all ,it&#8217;s usually hard to exert control over the tone of the session. 
		  Worse, some panels don&#8217;t allow for discussion, giving too much time to prepared presentations 
		  from each panelist. For these and other reasons, panels are a wild card, and often 
		  result in a fairly bland experience for everyone involved.&nbsp; When it works though, 
		  and the right people are invited and facilitated by the organizer in the right way, 
		  it can be the most enlightening session you&#8217;ll see at a conference. <br>
		</li><li><strong><img style="width: 267px; height: 195px;" alt="conversations by the posers" src="HowToConference_files/24-5.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="236" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="300">Posters</strong>: Some conferences have poster 
		  areas, where professionals or students put together summaries of their work for people 
		  to look at. This can often be a lot of fun. I like the fact that it&#8217;s an active environment: 
		  you walk around to different displays, and drive the experience (instead of the persistent 
		  passivity of almost every other kind of conference session). Posters are a great thing 
		  to stroll through if you get bored in the other sessions. Sometimes there are scheduled 
		  times where the posters are manned, so you can ask questions of the people that did 
		  the work. This can be great fun. Don&#8217;t be shy: usually they&#8217;re thrilled that anyone 
		  is looking at their stuff, much less asking questions.&nbsp; However, posters have 
		  a short summary that appears in the proceedings, and if it&#8217;s a research project, similar 
		  material probably exists on a website. So you can get some of this experience after 
		  the conference.&nbsp;(If you read a paper later and find it interesting, email the 
		  person that wrote it and tell them so. You'll get a direct line for any questions 
		  you might have).<br>
		</li><li><strong>Demos</strong>: Some conferences have demo sessions, where each person or 
		  team gets 10 minutes to demo a specific design or research project. This can be fun 
		  to watch if the time limits are short: You&#8217;ll see actual designs and work, and judge 
		  for yourself how useful or interesting it is. If the demos are short, it won&#8217;t be 
		  long before one demo ends and another one takes the stage. <br>
		</li><li><strong>Paper sessions</strong>: At more academic conferences, there are paper sessions, 
		  where the authors of selected paper submissions get a chance to talk for 10 or 15 
		  minutes about their paper. This is usually the biggest waste of time for conference 
		  attendees. First, if there are proceedings, all of the papers are available to you 
		  to read or skim at your leisure (think: flight home).&nbsp; Worse, these folks were 
		  accepted on their ability to write a good paper, not on their ability to engage or 
		  communicate through a presentation. In many cases, the presenters simply talk through 
		  the same outline and structure that is in the paper (sometimes even scrolling through 
		  the actual text of the paper, reading highlight (yes I&#8217;ve seen this)), which makes 
		  for dull presentations.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a very poor use of 15 minutes of air time. Speakers 
		  at these sessions should receive coaching on general presentation skills, and on&nbsp; 
		  how to convert their paper into an interesting talk, but I don&#8217;t know of a single 
		  conference that does this.<br>
		  <br>
		  Also keep in mind that the way papers are selected impacts the kind of material you 
		  are likely to see. At more academic/research conferences, the focus is on claims and 
		  interested ideas that have verifiable data or research to support them. Often the 
		  result is content more focused on esoteric ideas with great research and data, than 
		  interesting or creative ideas with little or no research and data. Depending on your 
		  interests and the kind of work you do, you might find one or the other not very useful.<br>
		  <br>
		  If you do read or attend the paper sessions, give the folks individual feedback. The 
		  authors put their name and email on them for a reason. The want you to contact them! 
		  Ask them questions! If you find a good paper, take 30 seconds a drop them a line telling 
		  them so. Very few people actively reward the folks that they are benefiting from. 
		  Nothing will make the paper authors day more than to get a short note from a peer 
		  or a colleague telling them they enjoyed the paper.&nbsp; Even better: those short 
		  emails can lead to connections that might be reinforced at the next conference.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <h3>Coming up with a plan</h3>
	  <p>A day before the heart of the conference begins, sit down with the proceedings and 
		the small guidebook or agenda that they often provide you with. (Sometimes this is available 
		on the website, sometimes you pick it up at the conference when you register). Go through 
		the guidebook with a pen, and mark anything that looks interesting. If you find things 
		that sound cool but vague, flip open the proceedings and check them out. If it looks 
		like something better captured in a paper, then it's probably not worth going to. Circle 
		all of the sessions that look interesting, and if two or more occur at the same time, 
		flag the one you want to go to first. </p>
	  <p>Then during the actual conference, go to the first session you&#8217;ve marked. Have a plan 
		to bail after 15 minutes if you&#8217;re bored. Odds are it&#8217;s not going to get better. Go 
		to the next session in that time slot that interested you. Repeat the same thought process. 
		Worst case, you can always return to one of the other sessions. The result is that you 
		maximize your time spent in sessions you will actually enjoy, and minimize your time 
		spent bored, hoping things will get better. If you run out of sessions to go to, head 
		over to the trade show area if there is one. During sessions is a good time to introduce 
		yourself to the various people manning the different booths. I&#8217;ve had some of my best 
		conference experiences in conversations that started this way.</p>
	  <h3>After hours conference socializing</h3>
	  <p><img alt="dinner" src="HowToConference_files/24-8.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="170" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="300">Some conferences have 
		scheduled social events or dinners one of the nights of the conference. I find these 
		events are often nice, but are in places and environments where it&#8217;s really hard to 
		meet new people. Often, people spend most of their time at these events with people 
		they already know, or the people they came to the conference with. If you are attending 
		the conference alone, these events can feel very cliquish and elitist. I don&#8217;t think 
		anyone intends for this to be so, but often nothing is set up to minimize or inhibit 
		this social tendency.</p>
	  <p>If you can manage it, you want to try to have met enough people in the workshops and 
		other sessions in the previous day, that you can wander around at the social, and say 
		hi to people. If you made some decent connections, you&#8217;ll be able to jump in on some 
		conversations about meet more people. If you have a few drinks, and can get into the 
		right mindset, you can have a lot of fun bouncing around between different groups.</p>
	  <p>Structured receptions aside, everyone at a conference eats dinner, whether there is 
		something set up through the conference or not. If you can find other folks and take 
		them to dinner, you&#8217;ll find its a great way to build some relationships. When 4:30 or 
		5pm rolls around, every single person at the conference is thinking about where they&#8217;re 
		going to go to dinner, and who they&#8217;re going to go with. Try to set yourself up with 
		a plan early in the day, and ask people you run into or meet what their plans are. Often 
		they&#8217;ll say that don&#8217;t have any, which is your ticket to make some. </p>
	  <p>One idea I&#8217;ve used is to tell everyone I met that day to meet at 6pm at a hotel lobby, 
		and for them to tell others the same. Then whoever shows up goes to a nearby restaurant 
		together, breaking into groups if necessary.&nbsp; If you ask enough people odds are 
		good you&#8217;ll have a nice sized group. If things go well, and you&#8217;ve got a fun crowd, 
		you might head out for drinks afterwards.</p>
	  <p>I think smart conferences provide ways to facilitate this, by having guides or delegates 
		from the conference lead this sort of process, especially for people that have never 
		been to the conference before. It&#8217;s in their interest to help people make social connections 
		at the conference: the more connections new attendees make, the more likely they are 
		to return.</p>
	  <h3>Take advantage of the trip</h3>
	  <p>If you traveled to another city or country to attend the conference, take advantage 
		of the opportunity. Most corporations will allow you an extra day or two, especially 
		if you&#8217;re willing to cover those extra expenses (tell the hotel this when you check 
		in, so you can get separate receipts). Part of what can make a conference effective 
		is it&#8217;s ability to give you new perspectives and ideas, and a great way to facilitate 
		that is to take advantage of what&#8217;s unique about the venue you are in.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	  <ul>
		<li><strong>Avoid chain restaurants and stores.</strong> You can go to these places 
		  at home. If you have to pay out of your own pocket for better/more interesting food 
		  or experiences, it's worth it. Also stay away from hotel restaurants. They tend to 
		  provide decent but safe and tame food choices. 
		</li><li><strong>Stay at the conference hotel if you're new, but otherwise..</strong> If 
		  you want to maximize your chances to meet and socialize, staying at the conference 
		  hotel can be a plus. But otherwise, take a chance and stay in a bed and breakfast, 
		  or somewhere downtown. Often they are about as expensive as professional hotels (sometimes 
		  much cheaper), and might only be an extra block or two away. I&#8217;ve found that having 
		  a short stroll each morning through an actual neighborhood in that city, gives a very 
		  different perspective on attending a conference, than only taking an elevator ride 
		  to the conference level of the same hotel.&nbsp; Most American hotels look and feel 
		  exactly the same. Many bed and breakfasts have individual charm and character, often 
		  in the spirit of the locale. 
		</li><li><strong>Take a road trip</strong>. Early in the conference ask around for people 
		  who might want to take a short road trip one night, or skip out on one afternoon&#8217;s 
		  sessions. If you end up going with other conference attendees, you have no reason 
		  to feel guilty about this. Your odds of learning something, and making connections 
		  are probably infinitely greater if you do something together outside of the conference, 
		  than if you do something inside.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h3>The benefits and drawbacks of going with coworkers</h3>
	  <p>It's common to attend a conferences with coworkers. This can be great. You&#8217;re likely 
		to bond more, and spend time together in a way that doesn&#8217;t happen at work. I&#8217;ve made 
		lots of friends from work by meeting them for the first time at conferences. It's natural 
		that if you work the trade show booth with someone, you&#8217;re likely to learn a lot about 
		them, and have a chance to meet people who may share your sense of humor.</p>
	  <p>However, if you have 2 or 3 friends that you&#8217;re traveling with, you might find it easy 
		to fall into a pattern where you spend most of your time with them. If it&#8217;s assumed 
		you&#8217;ll all eat dinner together every night, odds are your not going to meet many new 
		people, or experience other kinds of social situations. I&#8217;m not suggesting you should 
		avoid your coworkers (though sometimes there&#8217;s good reason to), instead, just be aware 
		of how you are spending your time. </p>
	  <p>One trick is to go to dinner together with coworkers, but require that everyone bring 
		someone they met at the conference ( the only downside to this is you potentially can 
		bore them to death, if you and your coworkers have trouble not talking about your company). 
	  </p>
	  <h3>Relax and have a good time</h3>
	  <p><img style="width: 287px; height: 231px;" alt="Relaxing3" src="HowToConference_files/24-3.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="234" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="300"> I&#8217;ve seen many folks take conferences way too seriously. 
		I find that I learn much better if I&#8217;m having fun, and enjoying the people I&#8217;m with. 
		I can&#8217;t do that if I&#8217;m fixated on getting to every session on time, or not staying out 
		too late, or trying to achieve any specific objective. If I&#8217;m relaxed and enjoying my 
		time away from the office, I&#8217;m more open to new ideas and approaches for what to do 
		when I get back.&nbsp; I believe strongly that this is the primary reason my employer 
		is sending me: to learn.&nbsp; Therefore, it&#8217;s my job to figure out what kind of environment 
		and state of mind I need to be in to&nbsp;best facilitate that objective.</p>
	  <p>I&#8217;m not saying that business trips and conferences should be converted into vacations. 
		Instead, I think everyone should be thinking about what the real opportunities to learn 
		are, and that they tend not to happen if you&#8217;re fixated on cramming in as much knowledge 
		or sessions in as short a time as possible. Instructional design and educational psychology 
		principles support this. The first rule of training you learn is that most people don&#8217;t 
		learn very much when they are under stress. </p>
	  <p>And as much as we like to think we&#8217;re critical to our teams and companies, they can 
		live without us for a few days. Plan your time before your trip so that while you&#8217;re 
		away, you can stay away. If you have people that work for you, set them up to cover 
		for expected situations that might arise. Give them your hotel phone number or cell, 
		and let them call you if they need you. Otherwise, you don&#8217;t need to check in or check 
		your email every day. Really, you don&#8217;t. You think you do, but you don&#8217;t. </p>
	  <p> If you find it hard, I bet it&#8217;s email addiction, more so than a real logical reason 
		to see what&#8217;s going on without you.&nbsp; I personally find it hard to stay away the 
		first day, but after that, it&#8217;s not so bad.&nbsp; I usually try to remember to sync 
		up my email before the flight back, so I can catch up on the plane flight home. </p>
	  <h3>How to justify going to conferences</h3>
	  <p>These days its harder for folks to justify attending conferences. I have a few suggestions 
		that might help towards making the case to go. </p>
	  <ul>
		<li><strong>You are an asset to your company</strong>. All assets require maintenance 
		  and enhancements. If instead of being a person, you were a piece of machinery, part 
		  of the corporate budget would go towards maintaining and upgrading you. Well, despite 
		  being human, you are an asset to the company. They should be investing the same percentage 
		  of budget towards maintaining and upgrading your skills as they do for the rest of 
		  the corporate assets. 
		</li><li><strong>Offer to train others in what you learned when you return</strong>.&nbsp; 
		  You can pitch your trip to a conference as a way to bring back skills and knowledge 
		  to the rest of the organization. If you have any experience in training or teaching, 
		  you can use that as your justification to attend instead of other co-workers. Get 
		  extra copies of the tutorial notes from other sessions. This is often a cheap way 
		  to get some extra coverage. 
		</li><li><strong>Trip report.</strong>&nbsp;Arguably one form of teaching others, the trip 
		  report is a write up of the sessions you attended, written for other folks in your 
		  group. The best trip reports make it easy for folks to dig up the right reference, 
		  or trigger people to come ask you questions. There&#8217;s rarely much value in 10 page 
		  trip report documents: no one reads them. Instead, a 2 or 3 page summary, with URLs 
		  and pointers to stuff for specific questions gets much more mileage. 
		</li><li><strong>Connect the value of the conference to business goals</strong>.&nbsp; If 
		  ease of use or customer satisfaction are company or division goals, you can claim 
		  that sending folks to conferences on those subjects will help pull in more expertise 
		  and knowledge towards helping the business. This argument puts less of the focus on 
		  your professional goals, and more on the company. 
		</li><li><strong>Recruiting</strong>.&nbsp; One of the reasons to send people to conferences 
		  is to recruit for open positions. If your team has had trouble filling certain jobs, 
		  or know that new openings are coming for your group, you can offer to do recruiting 
		  work while you&#8217;re there. Most conferences have job posting boards, or allow you to 
		  rent a booth for your company at the trade show. 
		</li><li><strong>Professional development.</strong> If you have career discussions with you 
		  manager, tie your career goals and future development to specific kinds of training 
		  or growth opportunities that you need. This might force you to rethink which conferences 
		  you&#8217;re going to (the cool conference might not be the one that&#8217;s likely to help your 
		  career/skill growth the most). In some organizations, folks will get to go to conferences 
		  provided they are presenting or participating in a session. If you don&#8217;t know what 
		  your group&#8217;s policy is, ask. 
		</li><li><strong>Split the costs</strong>. If you believe the conference is needed for your 
		  professional development, then you should want to attend regardless of who pays. Offer 
		  to split the costs. Or ask just for the time off without having to use up vacation 
		  time, and you pay your own way. This can be a way to prove the value of the conference, 
		  if you return with great stuff and teach others on your team. But it can also set 
		  a precedent for you paying your own way. You might position it as a trial: if you 
		  can show that it&#8217;s valuable, your manager will pay next time.</li>

	  <p>Some of these might be general travel tips, but they&#8217;re related - here goes:</p>

		<li><strong>Don&#8217;t use the conference bag, or lug around all the crap they give you. 
		  </strong>First, it makes you a mark as a tourist to carry the conference bag around 
		  outside the conference.&nbsp; Second, traveling in packs of people all using the same 
		  bag, all wearing name tags, makes you look like a cult member. You rarely need to 
		  lug around all of the stuff they give you (I recommend dropping off the proceedings 
		  at my hotel room as soon as I get it). Instead bring a light bag, with enough room 
		  for the small conference handbook/schedule, some paper, a pen, maybe something to 
		  eat, and some business cards. Travel light. You&#8217;ll feel much better at the end of 
		  the day if you haven&#8217;t been carrying 15 lbs of stuff all day. Don't bring your laptop 
		  so you can read your email. Go talk to someone instead. 
		</li><li><strong>Don&#8217;t wear your badge outside the conference.&nbsp; </strong>There is nothing 
		  sillier than a grown adult with a name tag (Unless it says Rupert or Cornelius on 
		  it). When you go back to your room, or leave the conference hotel, you are no longer 
		  at the conference. Take the badge and put it in your pocket, or with your wallet/purse 
		  so you don&#8217;t lose it. 
		</li><li><strong>Ship your proceedings and stuff back to your office. </strong>If there are 
		  proceedings and other materials, such as books you've purchased, arrange to have them 
		  sent back to your office. Find a nearby shipping store, and drop off your stuff the 
		  day before you leave. This saves you the burden of packing 10 lbs of stuff into your 
		  luggage or carryon. Sometimes the conference center has a little office that will 
		  do this for you. It's usually not too expensive and you may be able to expense it. 
		</li><li><strong>Sit near the back if your not planning on staying.</strong>&nbsp; If I&#8217;m 
		  at a conference that has concurrent sessions, which most do, I usually plan on bailing 
		  if I don&#8217;t like it in&nbsp; 10 or 15 minutes. Knowing this, I tend to sit in the back. 
		  It makes it easier to leave without annoying people or the speaker. The downside to 
		  this tip is that sitting in the back does make it harder to connect with the speaker 
		  in the first place. An alternative is to always try to grab an aisle seat. 
		</li><li><strong>Ask lots of questions</strong>. Learning is a contact sport. If you don't 
		  make your experiences engaging for yourself, you are guaranteed to be bored. Talk 
		  to speakers, paper authors, booth people, the folks sitting next to you, whoever. 
		  Ask for recommendations for books, websites or other conferences. If you don't become 
		  an active participant in your own learning, don't be surprised if not much of what 
		  you experience is relevant to you. 
		</li><li><strong>Some conferences serve breakfast, some don&#8217;t</strong>.&nbsp; Know this before 
		  you end up 15 minutes into the first session, sitting in the middle of the room (making 
		  it hard to get up and leave), and realize you&#8217;re starving.&nbsp; Same for lunch or 
		  snacks. Sessions tend to start early, so you probably won't have time to grab something 
		  before the conference if you don't plan for it. 
		</li><li><strong>Get some exercise every day.</strong> Yeah, I've said this before, but it's 
		  worth saying again. Your mind functions better if your body has been active too. Most 
		  hotels, especially the fancy corporate conference center types, have nice weight rooms 
		  or pools. Take the time to get some exercise at least every other day. Skip a morning 
		  session or skip out early if you have to, to find time for this. If you hate exercise, 
		  and are in a city, go for a long walk instead of taking a cab.&nbsp;Personally, if 
		  I don&#8217;t exercise every day I&#8217;m really not a nice person to be around, and I struggle 
		  with sitting and listening for hours on end.&nbsp;I stress out easier, and am generally 
		  less happy.&nbsp;I think most people are more likely to enjoy the conference,&nbsp;and 
		  return home healthy if they break a sweat a few times while they're away.</li>

	  <h3> Finding conferences to go to </h3>
	  <p>There are a few different places to go, depending on what field your looking for. <a href="http://www.acm.org/events/">ACM</a>&nbsp;is a good place to start for any computer 
		science related field. Most of their subgroups have annual conferences. Google searches 
		with your topic of interest + "conference" can often be the fastest way to find leads. 
	  </p>
	  <p>For UI design related stuff, the <a href="http://www.stc.org/index.asp">STC</a> maintains a <a href="http://www.stcsig.org/id/03conferences.html">good list here</a> . </p>
	  <h3>Last notes and conferences I&#8217;ve attended </h3>
	  <p>Your mileage may vary on all of the above. Everyone has different travel and learning 
		preferences. So I don&#8217;t recommend following this essay very closely. Instead, I hope 
		it helps to raise some questions and thoughts about what you might want in a conference, 
		and how you might go about getting the most of the time you spend there.</p>
	  <p>For reference here&#8217;s a list of professional conferences I remember going to.&nbsp;I've 
		been to many others, but these are the major ones I can remember. The recommendations 
		in this essay may be biased towards CHI since i've been there a few times:</p>
