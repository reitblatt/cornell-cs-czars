<h2 align=center> The Recruiting Process: After the Application is Submitted </h2>

Kozen, Tardos and Zabih are presently on the Cornell faculty recruiting 
committee. They spoke informally about their experiences and offered advice
to those who will be applying for faculty positions. 

Kozen is the chair of the committee and offered a brief introduction
to and explanation of how the process goes forward. He noted that it
is important to know what occurs and to avoid acquiring erroneous
preconceptions of how such things work. Most places interview in 
the springtime. It is probably better not to send letters immediately. 
The committee at Cornell will look over the folder/application and then 
decide whether to request letters or not. The committee meets once a week
and looks over the folders as they're received. They decide if other 
faculty should take a look at them and offer an evaluation. If an applicant
looks promising, then the committee will ask that reference letters be 
sent. In general, good candidates will spring to the top fairly quickly while
less good candidates will filter down. Applicants from top places will have 
their letters requested automatically. 
<p> 

Kozen pointed out that, at least at Cornell, recruiting is discussed a 
lot at faculty meetings. For example, right now there is huge load on 
the systems faculty, and therefore candidates in systems are desirable. 
In other words, area counts along with references, publications, and so on. 
The committee along with input from the entire faculty will converge 
on a list of names and decide on people to invite for interviews. The 
committee offers a report every week to the faculty on what the 
current status of the search is. He also pointed out that reference 
letters in general tend to be a bit overblown, and thus are usually taken 
as such. 
<p> 

An interactive discussion about various aspects of the process followed
Kozen's introduction. Zabih pointed out that while the committee will 
decide whom to <em> invite </em> (based on input from committee and other
faculty members) the faculty as a whole will decide whom to <em> hire. </em>
Cornell is not necessarily representative in this respect. Other departments
are known to have more powerful committees or other sorts of decision-making
arrangements. Zabih suggested that the single most important thing in the 
applicants folder is the <em> area </em> of specialization. The faculty
will need to decide how much emphasis to place on different things. Kozen
suggested that sometimes faculty will hold a position open while waiting for 
just the right person to fill it. 
<p> 

Tardos offered some insights into the interviewing process. She pointed
out that interviewing in industry is very different from interviewing 
for an academic position. In academia, you will talk to people who know 
nothing about your area and will be more interested in general sorts 
of things. They will want to know what your research plan is, what you 
expect to do yourself, what ideas you might have for your students to 
work on and where you're planning to get funding. They'll likely also 
be interested in what you expect to teach. Tardos' advice is to be 
prepared to teach just about everything at the undergraduate level and 
also graduate courses in your own area. Kozen mentioned that a common 
complaint among interviewers was candidates who only know about their
own specific research area. Tardos agreed and added that it's impressive
when a candidate is aware of local research projects, particularly those 
even tangentially related to their own. Zabih gave examples of other
sorts of general questions that might be asked, e.g., What is the 
next hot thing in your area? What's going to make you famous? Tardos
added: What will be happening in your area in the next 10 years? What 
major results came out of the last 10 years? Zabih pointed out that during 
the interview process (which is extensive and exhausting) the faculty 
are on the ball. They're trying to figure out if they can live with you
for the next few years/decades. During interview talks people <em> are 
</em> paying attention, which makes giving the talk both an opportunity
and a challenge. Tardos added that applying to all of the top schools, 
even if you know some are not where you'd like to be is a good thing. 
Being invited to give a talk not only helps your job prospects, but also 
gives you some exposure and the chance to meet more people in the field.
<p> 

A question was raised about what sort of flexibility there was in 
scheduling the interviews. Kozen answered and pointed out that there
is a huge host of constraints, and especially near the end of a term 
things can become very tight. Along the lines of scheduling and
constraints, Tardos offered some insight into how to handle being 
half of an instance of the "two-body problem." Essentially her advice
is to keep quiet. This is a very big problem with no easy solutions. When 
the two bodies are in completely different fields, it can be even more 
trying, as different fields have different interviewing schedules. 
One partner may have to make a decision before the other has even been 
given any offers. Even when both are in CS, it's best to refrain from 
commenting on the problem and wait until offers show up to make a decision. 
During the interview process, you may be asked whether such a problem 
exists. (For the record, Tardos pointed out that it is illegal to ask 
personal questions, but in general people are well-intentioned, so 
reacting badly is not in your best interest.) When deciding how to 
answer, keep in mind that every such illegal question has a legal 
alternative. Thus, the best thing to do is to answer the legal question. 
For example: My interviewing and decision is not related to that of 
any other person. Obviously, don't point out that the question is illegal
and be as friendly and polite as possible. 
<p> 

Zabih pointed out that the entire interview process is grueling. Essentially
it will consist of 10 or more half hour discussions with faculty members 
who are not in your area. The faculty will be pushing you both to find
out if you have a vision for your research and if you will be a reasonable 
colleague. Kozen advises that maximizing the number of people to connect 
with at a given place is a good strategy. Tardos pointed out that the 
web has become a great resource. Before arriving you can get a lot of 
information about the people you'll be meeting. Kozen strongly urged
that if you're going to be meeting someone even close to your area, to make 
sure you've read that person's papers closely enough to have more than 
a passing familiarity. Zabih pointed out that from the time of your arrival 
to the time of your departure, everything is about business, including
breakfast, lunch and dinner. In other words, don't make any other plans 
for your time there. 
<p> 

Several questions were asked regarding post-docs, teaching positions and 
publications. Tardos noted that post-docs can strengthen your position
as an applicant. The drawback is that in a short (one-year or less) post-doc, 
there's barely time to do any research at all before the interview cycle 
starts. People will be looking for post-Ph.D. research and therefore 
a two-year post-doc might be preferable. It was pointed out that in general 
you will get one shot at a faculty position. It is extremely rare if not 
unheard of for someone to be interviewed twice at the same place. 
<p> 

Regarding publications, the entire panel seemed to agree that quality
matters more than quantity. Serious publications are a
necessity. Zabih pointed out that being known (through conferences,
publications, etc.) is a very good thing. A question was raised about
whether teaching at a small college (as opposed to taking a post-doc)
was an effective strategy immediately after the Ph.D. The general
consensus seemed to be that a post-doc would allow more time for
research and that it was hard to move "up" from a college to a
university. The institution you're immediately coming from matters a
lot. Recall that Cornell automatically collects letters from the top
few places. Kozen pointed out that some might prefer a position at a
"teaching college" and Tardos agreed, noting that taking a position at
a place like Cornell is a complete gamble, whereas a tenure-track
position at a lesser-ranked university or a small college is probably
not as risky.
<p>

After a question on gender ratios, Kozen pointed out that it is
illegal to discriminate in hiring practices. There is a lot of
interest in balance and diversity. Tardos mentioned that there may be
some bias in interviewing. That is, there is a lot of pressure to
interview women and other minorities, but that this pressure does not
at all reflect in hiring decisions.
