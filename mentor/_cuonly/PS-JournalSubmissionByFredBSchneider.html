<h2 align=center> The Journal Submission Process </h2>
<h4 align=center> Ph.D. Professional Seminar. 9 April 1997. </h4>

<hr> 
Schneider spoke about his experience with the "journal business."
More specifically, he talked about about what happens between
submitting a paper to a journal and publication. This talk is geared
both towards authors and referees. There are number of steps in this 
process, and they are examined in varying degrees of detail. 
<p> 

Step 1: Author writes a paper. <br> 
(See <A
HREF=http:/www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Courses/Spring-97/CS706/lnt-halpern.html>Halpern
and Trefethen's talk</A> for details on this.)  <p>

Step 2: Author submits the paper. <br> 
There are two questions that will need to be decided at this point, namely
where to submit the paper and to whom. The former will be deferred until 
later in the talk. The first thing to keep in mind when submitting the 
paper is to follow the directions. In the back of most journals will be 
instructions for submission. Do not violate these. Breaking these rules 
runs the risk of incurring the wrath of the editor. There are generally
three possible options when deciding who to submit the paper to: 
<ul> 
<li> Submit to the editor-in-chief. <br> 
<li> Submit to the area editor. <br> 
<li> Submit to the editor closest to you geographically. <br> 
</ul> 
The editor-in-chief will decide whether to handle the paper personally, 
or to pass it on to someone else. Any other editor you submit to will 
probably not pass it on. What the editor needs to do at this point is 
to choose reviewers for the paper, send the paper to the reviewers and 
given their feedback decide whether to accept the paper or not. 
In general then, it is good to submit to the person who is best suited
in choosing reviewers for your particular paper, if at all possible. 
<p> 

Step 3: The editor chooses reviewers/referees. <br> 
Reviewers and referees are anonymous to the author, thus it is 
best, as alluded to previously, to submit papers to someone who knows 
something about the subject. In most cases this will be the area 
editor. Few authors do this, however, and often editors will receive 
papers which are not central to their own area. The question now 
becomes: How do editors choose reviewers for papers? Three strategies
are available: 
<ul> 
<li> If the editor is an expert, then choosing reviewers is easy. 
<li> Otherwise, editors will often look at the bibliography and related
work as a great source of reviewers. Often the editor may not choose
directly from the bibliography list, but instead look at bibliographies
of papers referenced in the paper in order to find reviewers. This process
can continue to many levels away from the paper under consideration in 
order to find experts in the field who will be good referees. 
<li> Another source of information is to ask colleagues to whom the paper
should be sent. They can be a great source of information as well. 
</ul> 

Step 4: The paper goes to reviewers. <br> 
The editor will send the paper to (generally) between 2 and 4
reviewers.  Having only two reviewers is usually not the best
strategy, as the editor may receive completely conflicting
advice. Three or four will probably provide a better sense of what to
do with a particular paper. When choosing reviewers editors try to
avoid having more than one reviewer from the same department, and they
try to avoid choosing close collaborators of the author (for example
thesis advisors, previous co-authors, etc.)  Occasionally an editor
may receive a request from the author that a certain person not be
chosen as a referee. The editor should try to respect these
requests. After the reviewers are chosen, the editor waits.  <p>

Step 5: The editor sends reminders to reviewers. <br> 
After three months the editor will send reminders to reviewers. At some 
point a reviewer may write back and say that they are too busy, or that 
the paper is not in their area. If as a referee you are declining to 
review a paper, it is considerate to offer some suggestions to the editor of 
who might be a good referee. It's best that these people not be "famous," 
as the editor will undoubtedly have thought of the obvious choices, 
but rather suggest people who are doing good work in the area, but are 
not so well known. Note: the cycle of reminding reviewers and waiting may 
occur more than once. 
<p> 

Step 6: The editor receives reviews and makes a decision. <br> 
When the reviews are returned the editor reads them and makes 
a decision. Schneider notes that he never tries to determine if the
reviews are semantically correct. He prefers to operate under the 
assumption that the referee is always right. This is actually fair because
if the referee <em> is </em>  correct then the recommendation should
be followed. If the referee is making a mistake, for example saying 
that the paper has flaws, then even if the paper doesn't have flaws it 
needs to be rewritten and clarified so that the referee can be convinced
that it doesn't. In short, the onus is on the author to present the 
material in such a way that it can be evaluated fairly.
<p>
When evaluating the reviews there are number of decisions about the 
fate of the paper that the editor can make: 
<ul> 
<li> Accept the paper as is. This is actually done very rarely in 
practice. 
<li> Accept the paper with minor revisions. Again, this is also done
relatively rarely. In this case, the editor has committed to publishing 
the paper, but may end up in the position of struggling to get the author 
to make the minor revisions. There's no real reason to do this. 
<li> Ask for a revision. If the referees and the editor feel that the 
paper is publishable, then this is typically what is done. 
<li> Ask for a major revision. This can be thought of as a "non-rejection" 
rejection, in which an extensive rewrite will be required from the
author in order to make the paper acceptable. 
<li> Reject the paper outright. This means the paper is dead as far 
as that particular journal is concerned. 
</ul> 
<p> 

Step 7: Author revises, review cycle begins again. <br> 
After the author revises the paper, assuming that choice was made, then
the editor will send the revised version back to the referees. In general, 
the same referees should be chosen for each round of revisions. This is 
more fair to the author, and also easier on the editor as well. 
A typical paper will go through one major revision and one minor revision. 
A minor revision may or may not involve the referees, as it may be possible 
for the editor to determine that the appropriate changes were made. 
The whole process from submission through reviews to being ready for
publication may take up to a year or 18 months.
<p> 

Step 8: Acceptance and typesetting. <br> 
Once a paper has been accepted, then it goes into the queue of papers
that have been accepted to that particular journal. Once the paper is
sent to the typesetter, galley proofs may be sent to the author for a
final check. In general, an author has 48 hours to "okay" the galley
proofs. This is a real deadline, which, if missed, may cause the paper
to be dropped from the upcoming edition of the journal and pushed off
to the next one.  <p>

The author would like the submit-review-revise cycle to go as quickly
as possible. And of course the referees would like their job to be as
easy as possible. There are things that the author can do to
facilitate this. First, write a clear and clean paper. Have other
people read and critique it before submission. This is actually very
important and could save at least one iteration in the review-revise
cycle. After receiving comments from referees, it may be tempting to
simply send back a revised version of the paper. A better approach
would be to include a discussion of how you addressed the concerns of
the referees. Make it very easy for the referees to quickly check that
you made the changes that were asked of you. Of course, you will not
always agree with everything that the referees propose. However, be
sure to do <em> something </em> for every complaint if at all
possible, even if they may be only cosmetic changes. Also, provide
believable reasons why you're not making a certain change if you
decide not to. 
<p> 

The question of where to submit your paper is obviously very
important. Be familiar with the journals in your area. There are two
classes of journals, those published by professional societies (for
example, IEEE, ACM) and those published by companies. The
former are probably better choices in most cases. Journals published
by professional societies tend to be cheap to subscribe to, with a
faster turnaround, a bigger audience and a higher standard.  Moreover,
editors for such journals are chosen by the members of the
professional society. In contrast, journals published by private
companies are more expensive and usually have a narrower focus. Also,
the editorial board choices seem to be more politically driven than in
professional societies. The thing to keep in mind is that in general a
high quality editor will choose high quality referees who will
probably give you more valuable feedback than "lower quality"
referees. There are exceptions to every rule of course, and there are
several good publications which are put out by private companies, and
they shouldn't be overlooked.  <p>

Finally, Schneider offers some pointers on how to be a good referee. 
First, refereeing is anonymous, and referees should not talk about 
papers until after they're published. There are several facets to 
your job when writing a referee report. First, you need to advise
the editor on what you think should be done with the paper. Second, 
you will need to establish your credibility both with the editor 
and the author. State what you think the main contribution of the paper
is, explain what you think the problems are and justify your 
conclusions. Finally, give feedback to the author about the 
paper, with regard to both the exposition and the technical results. 
It is also perfectly fine to send a cover letter to the editor. Here 
you can say things to the editor that you may not want the author to 
see. 
<p> 

The review itself should be between one and five pages. It's clearly 
a problem if the review is longer than the paper itself. However, it's 
probably better to err on the side of being too detailed. Include a 
one paragraph summary of the paper. This establishes that you read the 
paper and what you understand it's contribution to be. Offer a 
succinct recommendation to the editor. Outline your major points 
of concern. The best form is probably to list them point by point rather 
than attempting to write flowing prose. Also number them, this will allow
easy reference for you, the author and the editor later. You may want to 
follow this up with minor points (spelling, sentence structure, 
grammar and so on) or even mark a copy of the manuscript and send 
that back. (Although, sending a marked copy runs the risk of someone 
doing a handwriting analysis and figuring out who you are!) 
<p> 

When writing reviews, keep in mind that a distinctive style of 
writing or typesetting may not be such a great idea for anonymity 
purposes. Also, take care not to be too negative. Be professional and 
neutral in tone, not sarcastic. The cover letter to the editor is the 
place to vent, if necessary. Never say "you" when writing the review to 
refer to the author. Avoid such personalization and use phrases like 
"the paper," "the author," etc. 
<p> 

Ph.D holders will be both authors and reviewers, thus it is a good idea
to have a solid understanding of the process, and what can be done both
as an author and a review to make the journal submission process 
faster and easier on everyone. 
<p> 

<hr> 
In a short discussion after the talk about conference papers
vs. journal papers, Schneider made the observation that the review
process for journal papers makes such paper tend to be much less buggy
than conference papers. Also, conference proceedings are not
necessarily archived, whereas libraries will not throw out a
journal. An approach for graduate students might be to submit to a
conference and then turn that paper into a journal paper. Some of the
top conferences will do this automatically with the top papers from
that conference.
