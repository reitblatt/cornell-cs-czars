<hr> 
Think of teaching as a process, with many factors that will 
influence effectiveness, among them: 
<ul>
<li> Teaching <b>style</b>. For example, in this department there is an 
ongoing debate about whether using intuition or formalism is the 
best approach. You should of course do what works best for you. 

<li> The <b>students</b> themselves. There is a wide range of ability and 
preparation among students, and this needs to be taken into account. Attempt
to satisfy the needs of as many of the students as possible.

<li> <b>Goals</b>. The goals of the teacher, the students, the department 
and the university may or may not always coincide. 

<li> <b>Social obstacles</b>. There may be counterproductive attitudes
among students, a lack of focus due to the rest of "college life," etc. 
</ul>
<hr>
Always keep in mind that <b>education takes place within the head of 
the student.</b>

Traits of an instructor: 
<ul>
<li> <b>Talent</b>. <br>
 Talent can encompass many things, some of which can be 
modified by the instructor, some of which can't. These include
charisma, timing, a sense of humor, aesthetic judgment, accent, etc.
A lack of talent can be compensated for. Be sure to recognize your 
strengths and weaknesses in this area and exploit or adjust for them 
accordingly. 
<p>
<li> <b>Skill</b>. <br>
This includes things such as organization, preparation and 
presentation style, all of which are under the direct control of the 
instructor. Organization applies to both individual lectures and 
the course as a whole. Each should be a cohesive, well-structured 
unit. Preparation is self-explanatory, but absolutely
mandatory. Before a course even starts, several weeks worth of preparation
should have gone into designing/updating it. Presentation style is 
also important. Keep things slow and say things in many different ways 
as different students will learn differently. Be as precise as possible. 
Allow time for reflection and "sinking in." 

<p>
More on formalism "vs." intuition: Is there really a conflict here? 
Probably not. Both are necessary and complement each other.

<h2>Formalism<------------------->Intuition </h2>

</center>

<p>
To move from formalism to intuition is what is involved during 
the process of reading/synthesis. The other direction involves
writing/analysis. 

<p>
Adaptability is also an important trait of any good instructor. Be
aware of when to give guidance (without spoonfeeding) and when to
allow for creativity.  Also, make an effort to remind oneself of what
it's like not knowing anything about a particular subject. There are
no stupid questions.  Try to understand what the student is having
trouble with even if he/she is not doing a good job of articulating
the problem.

<p>
With regard to course materials: Be sure not to make things too hard.
There will always be some students who will have no trouble at all,
and some who will inevitably flounder. Aim your material below the
level of the top of the class, but high enough to challenge the
average. (In other words, be challenging, but not overwhelming.) Be
absolutely certain that homework and exams are as unambiguous as
possible.  Have clear and precise guidelines for late homeworks,
academic integrity, and grading.

<p>
<li> <b>Attitude</b>. <br>
One's attitude as a teacher can have a tremendous impact on a 
course as well as on individual students. Two things to keep in mind: 

<p>
Positivism: Have a positive attitude about the subject and course at hand. 
Demonstrate excitement, enthusiasm and a love for the subject. Do not 
be afraid to say: "This proof is beautiful." 

<p>
Selflessness: Always put the student first. Except for extreme 
circumstances (earthquake, death in the family, bomb threats) always 
be at your office hours. Moreover, make sure that your office hours
and the TAs are spread over the entire week so that students have a choice. 
</ul>
<hr> 
Finally, contrary to popular opinion, good teaching can be done even at 
large research universities. Make an effort to demonstrate this.
