<h2 align=center> Life in Academia </h2>
<h4 align=center> Ph.D. Professional Seminar. 30 April 1997. </h4>
<h4 align=center> Robert Constable, Brian Smith & Ronitt Rubinfeld </h4>

Constable, Smith and Rubinfeld discussed their perspectives on life 
in academia at a top research university. Smith suggested that each 
member of the panel mention what they felt were the most relevant 
issues facing them on a day-to-day basis as faculty members. They 
proceeded to discuss the pros and cons of academic life. 
<p> 

Constable stated his belief that being a professor is one of the best 
jobs in the world. He noted that the layperson's perspective of faculty
life (little time spent on classes, free afternoons and evenings, etc.) 
is wrong. He mentioned an instance of a faculty member who, while working 
for industry has time to sail and have a social life, but that while at 
Cornell find that
that is really not possible. For nine months of this year, life as a faculty
member is very intense. However, the good part that is that there is an 
incredible amount of freedom for faculty members. Essentially, professors
do not have bosses or supervisors in the traditional sense of the word. 
"You're your own boss." On the other hand, the danger is that one has the 
opportunity to make big mistakes. 
<p> 

Rubinfeld also pointed out the long hours and high stress level, but noted
that with these comes substantial rewards. There is the opportunity 
to do research, and to have students. When one's students are doing well 
that can be a very rewarding experience. She noted that producing good
students can provide satisfaction years down the road. To her mind, this 
balances out the high stress nature of the job. She notes that there
are good research jobs in industry, but they don't allow substantial 
interaction with students. Students will tend to "keep people young"
and the fact that there are always new students with new ideas is something
that can help to keep life at a university interesting, whereas at 
a research lab it can be easier to stagnate. 
<p> 

Smith followed up on the freedom issue. He said that it is really hard 
to describe how much freedom is given to faculty members. With 
careful planning, it is possible to get to the point where you can do 
almost anything. He claims the stimulation in an academic environment 
is much better than at a company or industrial lab, with a constant 
flow of visitors, students, new ideas, etc. In systems, having the leverage
of students and a group helps. In industry it is necessary to provide 
lots of justification for what you're working on. The downside is that 
sometimes the signal-to-noise ratio is low. That is, lots of time is 
spent on things like meetings, fund-raising, teaching, etc. There is not 
much focused time to spend on research. All of this leads to a a complex
and sometimes overwhelming life. 
<p> 

A question was raised about how much time is spent realistically on 
various things as a faculty member. Constable pointed out that there had 
recently been an analysis done of exactly that, and that faculty work 
an average of 65 hours/week, which didn't include time spent on weekends. 
In response to a question about having students, Rubinfeld pointed out 
that it's not necessary to have a lot of students, that in fact fewer 
students may be desirable. She also mentioned that summer is a great time
to work at other places with other colleagues. 
<p> 

Constable noted that for living a "life of the mind" there really isn't 
a better place than at a university. Working with students can range 
from working intensely with just one or two students to building a large
system which will involve a large group of students. The university 
environment allows you to express yourself as in individual very well. 
In contrast, while working at a research lab there is always the possibility 
of a change in direction at upper levels which can cause a complete 
dismissal of or drastic change to whatever project you happen to be 
involved with. He gave an example of this happening to someone at Microsoft
when they decided to move the company into internet-related kinds of 
things. 
<p> 

Smith talked about the first few years or life after being hired as 
junior faculty member. He said there are three or four things that will 
take up most of your time and energy: 1) Teaching. You may have to 
teach a course you've never taught or even taken before. The teaching 
load varies from school to school and even with a "light" load of one 
course a semester can be a huge time sink. It is hard to know what to 
delegate. (For more information on teaching see both Smith's previous 
<A HREF=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Courses/Spring-97/CS706/smith.html>
talk </A> as well as <A HREF=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Courses/Spring-97/CS706/kozen.html>Dexter Kozen's</A>.) 
2) Fund-raising. Start-up funds will generally last 1-1.5 years. 
Writing proposals is an important skill that will need to be learned. 
3) Administrative duties. What will be expected of you depends on the 
department chair. Be careful not to do too much and to carefully choose
what you do decide to do. 4) Get students. Smith's advice is to build 
your group slowly at the rate of roughly one student per year. 
<p> 

In a follow-up, Rubinfeld noted that teaching really doesn't get 
that much easier as time goes on. Students will always take up a lot 
of time. Departmental duties are very important, as well. She noted 
that during the week the two or three hours she spends with her graduate
students is about all she can allocate for research. After hours, when 
the doors are locked is when uninterrupted research occurs. She notes
that during your first few years as a faculty member you are being
constantly evaluated from all sides: teaching, grant proposals, administrative
work, research, and so on. It can be depressing to realize that everyone
is checking up on you. She suggests that a good thing to do is to keep 
in mind that nothing is the end of the world. Bad things will happen 
occasionally, and the thing to remember is that there will always be 
another conference, another grant, another year. There is no one thing 
that you can't get past. 
<p> 

Constable noted that it's necessary to bear in mind that being a
professor is really having three jobs: researcher, teacher and
administrator. You will be evaluated on all three of these areas
constantly.  He noted that 8 of the top 10 universities in the world
are in the United States. The American university system is great, and
one reason is due to the competition involved. Research is evaluated
by colleagues around the world. During the hiring season, for example,
word spreads quickly about who the "stars" are. In general, within a
month the top people are identified and receive many offers of
interviews. He observed that such constant evaluation can be devastating. 
Even senior professors will receive very negative referee reports. 
The administrative area is where one's colleagues are all working together
on a common goal, and it can be tempting to do more than one should. 
<p> 

Several questions followed. Constable noted that morale at Cornell 
is excellent. Rubinfeld advised to be careful to understand how
the decision on who teaches what courses is made when interviewing at 
places. This can be very different from university to university. 
Constable noted that even though the faculty may be highly critical 
of each other's work internally, they all realize that the whole department/university wins big if a faculty member becomes "famous." Thus, there is a
a tendency to close ranks if an outside visitor is around. A lot of the 
success of the department hinges on reputation. Smith added that at
first-rate places the faculty will speak well of each other's research to
outsiders, whereas at second-rate places the faculty will tend to 
undercut one another. He added that there tends to be a "halo effect" 
at good schools, which can provide many opportunities that wouldn't 
be available at second-tier places. Constable stressed that there are 
several fairly small departments which are doing really great research, 
but because of their size are not so well-known. Rubinfeld added that 
one of the important things is to be at a place where the senior faculty
help the junior faculty with grant proposals, teaching, etc. 
When asked if anything could be done to alleviate the stress on junior
(and senior) faculty, the answer was essentially "no." The reason is 
that there will always be a few who are totally dedicated, and this will 
raise the bar for everyone else. The best universities will produce the 
best ideas and have the best people, and this will keep everyone 
striving to do the best that they possibly can. 
<p> 

To close, Rubinfeld added that she feels that being a professor is a great
job, with great colleagues and the opportunity to do great research. There 
is a high stress level, but she adds that the things she's spending time on 
are usually the things she wants to be spending time on. Smith added
that one could go to industry and conceivably make more money, but that 
in his estimation the people in industry tend not to reach their full 
potential, for reasons mentioned earlier. Constable reiterated that 
being a faculty member is an extremely rewarding and fulfilling career.
