</strong> </h3> <p>

As a graduate student preparing for a career in research, you have two
jobs: (1) do some good research, and (2) build a community around your
research topic.  These two jobs may seem to conflict with one another,
given that research is generally a solitary activity (or something
you do with the local gang in your lab) whereas networking is a social
activity, something you largely do away from home.  The demands of
your thesis committee may seem so immediate and crushing that you let
your community-building slide.  Or your thesis advisor may be locked
into the old patriarchal view that you will succeed professionally
because of your thesis committee's contacts and not because of your
own effort.  I want to offer another view: you are in charge of your
career, and the best way that you can <i>take</i> charge of your
career is to build a community around your research. </p><p>

This article is an introduction to professional skills for PhD
students, and the most important of these skills involve building
a professional network.  I will proceed as follows.  <a href="#section2">Section 2</a> provides a simple six-step model of the
networking process.  <a href="#section3">Section 3</a> considers
several advanced topics: noticing emerging themes in your area, using
consultation to organize things, ensuring that you get proper credit
for your contributions, learning to engage professionally with people
from different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds, and deciding
where to publish your work.  <a href="#section4">Section 4</a>
describes the relationship between your professional network and
your dissertation.  Both of them pertain to the process of knitting
yourself and your work into a set of professional relationships.
<a href="#section5">Section 5</a> reveals the mysteries of academic
language.  <a href="#section6">Section 6</a> explains how to get
an academic job, building on the networking you've done and on
the concepts that underlie networking.  <a href="#section7">Section
7</a> assumes that you have established yourself in the research
community and introduces the topic of advising others.  <a href="#section8">Section 8</a> explains how to get tenure, emphasizing
the "deep tenure" that you attain within your research community
rather than the details of departmental politics.  <a href="#section9">Section 9</a> presents several theories of your career,
based on other people's ideas.  My own theory of your career is
called incremental alignment.  Its main purpose is to keep you
from overgeneralizing when you find yourself in career circumstances
that aren't entirely positive.  <a href="#section10">Section 10</a>
presents a more advanced theory of networking, including the process
by which research fields become institutionalized.  <a href="#section11">Section 11</a> then examines the moral issues that the
process of leadership can raise.  An appendix provides an annotated
bibliography of books and articles on the topic of professional
networking. </p><p>

About the title, "Networking on the Network".  When I wrote the first
version of this article in 1993, the Internet was still big news in
most academic departments, and everyone was wondering how to use it.
Because I had been using the Internet for fifteen years, I thought
it might be useful to write an article for PhD students about how to
use the Internet as part of their professional networking.  The first
version of the article, accordingly, had a section explaining how
to network without the Internet, a second section about the various
pitfalls of the brand-new Internet medium, and a third section
about how to extend the traditional paper and face-to-face version
of networking by using e-mail.  As time went by, however, two things
changed.  First, my interactions with students and with helpful
people on the Internet caused me to add numerous additional sections
to the original article.  Most of these new sections presupposed
the Internet-based skills that I had outlined, but few of them were
otherwise specific to the Internet.  And second, the Internet became
so familiar in the general culture, and especially the culture of
undergraduate education, that new PhD students no longer needed any
instruction in its use.  In recent editions of "Networking on the
Network", therefore, I have eliminated much of the Internet-specific
material.  Perhaps someday I will think of a better, more descriptive
title for the article.  In the meantime, however, the title of this
article will have to remain somewhat askew from its contents. </p><p>

&nbsp; </p><p>

</p><h3> <strong> <a name="section2"> SECTION 2.  The Basic Steps </a>
</strong> </h3> <p>

Here, then, are some of the fundamentals of professional networking.
They will sound cumbersome and abstract.  You'll be able to skip
some of the steps as you get established in your field (or if, unlike
most of us, you can charm rooms full of strangers in twenty minutes),
but if you're starting from zero then the process really is this
complicated. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="basic-know"> (1) Do some good research. </a> </strong>
</p><p>

All of my advice in this article presupposes that you have done
some good research and are ready to report about it at professional
conferences.  There's a sense in which you don't even exist in the
profession until you have done some research and written some papers
about it that are at least capable of being circulated.  And once
you do finish that first round of publishable research and write
something about it, the substance of your research will very much
determine who you should be adding to your network. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="basic-identify"> (2) Identify some relevant people.
</a> </strong> </p><p>

Having done some research, it is time to identify relevant people
to network with.  "Relevance" here is reckoned in functional terms:
given how your particular professional world operates, with whom
do you have a mutual interest in making contact?  In the world of
research, mutual interest is almost always defined through the content
of your research: you wish to contact people whose research bears some
important relationship to your own.  Your network will thus consist,
more or less, of the people whose work you cite, at least the ones
who are still alive.  And when you cite someone's work, you should
form the intention of adding him or her to your network.  But how do
you identify these people?  Most of the methods are mundane: asking
people with good networks, chance mentions of people in conversation,
and the habitual scanning of bibliographies, abstracts, and conference
proceedings.  Get used to these mundane practices before you explore
anything fancier. </p><p>

Here is a way to think about it.  Let us say that your research
involves ethnographic study of grade-school teachers' strategies
for including computers in their lessons.  While you must certainly
identify any other people who conduct research on that exact same
topic, you should also cast your net more widely.  Start by chopping
your research interest into pieces; the pieces might be "ethnographic
research in classrooms", "research on teachers adopting computers",
"strategies for including computers in lessons", "ethnographic
research on people adopting computers", "grade-school teachers'
work strategies", "new technology in schools", and so on.  Take those
pieces to the library and locate the existing literature in each
area.  This will feel strange at first: if you've only worked with
ethnographers, then the non-ethnographic work on your topic will seem
foreign; if you've only worked with education people, then the work
of business people or sociologists will seem foreign; and if you've
only worked with people who study teachers' strategies, then the
work on students' strategies will seem foreign.  The vocabulary and
research agendas may well be different, and it may take some effort
to figure out what constitutes good research in a different literature.
But find the relevant literature anyway, photocopy it, read it,
get your head around its issues and worldview, highlight salient
passages, take notes, write full citations in your notebook, and look
particularly for the authors whose work you respect and whose values
you share. </p><p>

If this seems like a lot of work, think of it as shopping: the library
is a giant department store, and you are shopping for professional
colleagues.  Accumulate a "long list" of potential colleagues.  Study
their work and learn from it.  Figure out what elements your work
has in common with theirs.  Then practice explaining your research
in a way that puts those elements in the foreground and the other
elements in the background.  The general formula is "I'm interested
in [elements you have in common with the person you're talking to],
and to this end I'm studying [elements that you don't have in common
with them]".  For example, "I'm interested in how teachers adopt
computers, and to this end I'm conducting an ethnographic study of
some grade-school teachers' strategies for including computers in
their lessons", or "I'm doing ethnographic research on people adopting
computers, and my fieldwork concerns grade-school teachers ...".  Now
you are ready to build a community for yourself that includes relevant
people from several different research areas.  These people will be
like spokes in a wheel, of which you are the hub. </p><p>

In working through this exercise, you are already encountering two
fundamental principles of professional social life, both of which
will recur throughout this article.  The first one was already
well-known in classical rhetoric, and I will call it "articulating
commonalities".  The point here is to develop relationships with
people.  And relationships are founded on commonalities.  These
commonalities might include shared values, shared research topics,
shared goals, or anything else of a professional nature that you might
share with someone.  To articulate a commonality means formulating
language for it.  This will not always be easy.  Because the people
whose work you cite will often inhabit worldviews quite dissimilar
from your own, you may have to draw on the full resources of language
in order to identify the large, irregularly shaped patches of ground
that you share in common.  The recipe that I just provided for sorting
elements of your work into foreground and background is one simple
method of doing this, and you will develop other, more advanced
methods as you go along.  Think of yourself as growing and evolving
a distinct language for every one of your professional relationships.
Having done this, you can then proceed to explore differences,
disagreements, debates, and other stimuli to clear thinking.  Many
people avoid conflict because they want to preserve relationships.
As a result, they become unable to assert their opinions and their
distinctive intellectual contibutions in public, professional fora.
And indeed, disagreements that are conducted outside a framework of
articulated commonalities are most often confused, destructive, and
a waste of time.  Lacking such a framework, the combatants will lapse
into projection, stereotyping, sloppy thinking, and other such junk.
The principle of articulating commonalities is the secret to getting
along with people. </p><p>

The second principle of professional life that you are encountering
here is a concept from sociology called "structural holes".  (See
Ronald Burt, Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition,
Harvard University Press, 1995.)  A structural hole, intuitively
speaking, is a bunch of people who don't know each other but ought
to.  Your research topic almost certainly defines a structural hole,
and you occupy that hole precisely by building relationships with
all of the people whose research is related to your topic in several
different directions.  The different directions are crucial: you want
relationships with people from diverse communities.  The intuition,
again, is that these people ought to know one another, and you will
be providing a public service by serving as the go-between.  You
will not know in advance just how you will interconnect these people.
Perhaps they should all gather for a meeting.  Perhaps some of them
have useful ideas that could be used in the others' research.  Perhaps
several of them have useful ideas that can be combined to improve your
own research.  The more diverse people you build relationships with,
the more of these unpredictable opportunities will arise, both for
your own benefit and for theirs.  Occupying a structural hole also
alleviates the fear that derives from putting all of your eggs in one
basket.  If your contacts in one community somehow fail to appreciate
the importance of your work, then you will still have contacts in
several other communities who remain uncontaminated by the views of
the doubters. </p><p>

I am taking a strong stand here about the nature of networking, so
let me explain the point another way.  Many students ask themselves,
"which network should I join?", and they worry that they will make
the wrong choice.  After all, your social network defines your career
in a profound way, and if you choose an unfriendly network then you
can make your life miserable.  But this is the wrong way to think
about it.  You are not choosing which network to join; rather, you
are creating a new network of your own.  Your network is made out of
individuals -- the individuals whose research and outlook are related
to your own.  These individuals' own networks will overlap to some
extent, but they will not be identical.  Most of them will attend
several different conferences, publish in several different journals,
and so on.  You should do the same.  Don't spread yourself too thin
by trying to cultivate everyone who could possibly be relevant.  But
don't confine yourself to existing boundaries either.  </p><p>

Those, then, are the basic methods of identifying people to include
in your professional network.  How can you build on them using the
Internet?  To begin with, the most fundamental way of finding people
online is to help them find you.  This starts with your home page.
Your home page is a projection of your professional persona -- a way
for people to know who you are as a member of the profession.  If you
have had a past life in a professional field, then you instinctively
understand the point: your fate depends on how people perceive you,
and so it matters what image of yourself you project.  Your home page
should include four things:
</p><p>

 * complete contact information (paper mail and e-mail addresses, work
phone and fax numbers, that sort of thing), </p><p>

 * links to organizations you are associated with (your department,
laboratory, project, professional associations, events that you are
involved in organizing, classes you teach, etc), </p><p>

 * full citations to all of the publications you want people to know
about (these should ideally be linked to complete text for all of
those publications), and </p><p>

 * links to other Web-based facilities that you maintain, for example
a page of links to resources that are relevant to your research topic.
</p><p>

It is especially important to put your publications on your Web site.
This can be difficult, given that publishers generally ask you to sign
over your copyrights.  But even when this happens, you can still amend
the copyright form with a marginal phrase like "I retain the right
to post the paper on my Web site".  The publisher may grouch at you
or say no, but it's worth a try -- vastly more people will read your
work online than in the dusty pages of a journal.  The best situation
is when you publish in a journal (or conference proceedings) that is
itself online.  In that case you can link from your home page to the
official version of the publication, and the official version of the
publication can include a link back to your home page.  In general,
the more you spread around links to your home page, e.g., by always
including your URL in your bio when you write magazine articles and the
like, and by including it in all of your messages to discussion groups
and the like, the more it will help you to connect with others. </p><p>

Unless you know what you're doing, I do not recommend including
personal information on your professional Web page.  If you do want
to maintain a personal home page for your friends and family, or if
you want to post your baby pictures and jokes and links to TV show fan
pages, get an ISP account and create a completely separate home page
for that purpose.  I also do not recommend putting goofy stuff on your
professional home page.  Your professional home page need not be dour
and pompous, but it should not be frivolous either.  Humor is okay,
but professional humor.  It's a fine line. </p><p>

Having made yourself visible on the Web, you can also use the Web to
search for people whose work is relevant to your own.  Web searching
certainly does not replace library work.  But the library and Web sort
the world in very different ways, and you can accomplish a great deal
by moving back and forth between them.  Look for specialized online
resources that are specific to your field, directories of research
project in your field that people might have built on the Web, and
the home pages of relevant university departments and other research
institutions.  Hunt through them, and notice how badly designed most
people's home pages are for your purposes.  When you do find useful
materials, such as online research papers, be sure to capture URL's
and citations for future reference.  You might even consider creating
your own Web page with links to those resources, thus saving both
yourself and other people the trouble of searching for them again. </p><p>

You can also use online discussion groups to find people, but you
should do so cautiously.  If someone in a discussion impresses you,
don't approach them right away.  (It's obviously okay to answer
routine functional requests on the order of, "does anyone know ...?",
provided you simply answer the request and leave the networking for
later.)  Instead, head back to the library catalog and periodical
indexes (which are probably on-line anyway), look the person up,
read a sample of what they've written (especially any books they
might have published -- at least skim them), and proceed with the
next step.  Then use standard Web search tools to locate this person's
home page, which might include some citations or even complete papers.
Only if you cannot find any relevant publications should you consider
sending the person a concise note saying, "what you said about XXX
is interesting to me because of YYY; if you have an article on the
subject ready to distribute then I'd much appreciate a copy". </p><p>

Or, having listened in on a discussion group for a while and observed
its customs and conventions, you might consider contributing something
yourself.  Don't just react or chat.  Instead, write an intelligent,
self-respecting, unshowy, low-key, less-than-one-page message that
makes a single, clearly stated point about a topic that's relevant
to both their interests and your own, preferably but not necessarily
as a contribution to an ongoing discussion.  Since your message might
be read by people all over the world, avoid any slang or jokes which
might not travel well.  Sit on this message overnight to make sure
you're not just reacting to something or repeating a familiar point
that happens to make people in your community feel good.  If you're
feeling uneasy or compulsive about it then just throw it out and wait
for another day, or get comments from someone whose judgement you
trust. </p><p>

Having thus refined your message, contribute it to the discussion
group and see what happens.  If nothing happens, don't be too
concerned.  Part of having a public voice is that your audience
isn't always directly visible; you won't always get the same kind
of immediate feedback that you get in a one-to-one, face-to-face
interaction.  So resist the urge to agitate until you get a visible
response.  If your message happens to start a discussion then
listen respectfully, constructively acknowledge all halfway worthwhile
responses, and be sure you're not just reacting to things.  This
process might flush out some people worth adding to your network.
Or it might not.  In any case it will get your name out and will
establish your reputation as an intelligent and thoughtful person.
Remember: don't bother doing any of this until you've written up
some work and are ready to actually start building your network. </p><p>

One thing that does not work, in my experience, is broadcasting a
message to half the world saying, "I'm looking for people who are
working on such-and-such", or "I've written papers about X and anyone
would be welcome to read them".  I don't know why exactly, but such
broadcasts either don't reach the most worthwhile people, or the most
worthwhile people are too busy to answer them.  Whenever possible,
then, approach people as individuals.  What you <i>can</i> do,
aside from publishing your work and giving talks at conferences, 
is to send messages individually to small numbers of people saying,
"Can I ask your help?  I'm trying to locate people who are working
on such-and-such.  I've tried the obvious sources in journals and
indexes, but without much luck.  Any leads you can offer would be
much appreciated."  Only do this if you have a specific purpose in
mind for finding such people, such as organizing a workshop or other
professional activity. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="basic-court"> (3) Write to these people individually.
</a> </strong> </p><p>

The right way to start a professional relationships with someone whose
work is relevant to your own is not entirely obvious.  Unless you
are already well known in the person's field, you should <i>not</i>
simply approach them and say, "hey, I hear you're interested in ...".
The reason for this is profound, viz, whereas ordinary social life
calls on you to simply be yourself, professional life calls on you to
construct and maintain a complex professional persona that is composed
largely of your research, writing, and professional activities. </p><p>

Therefore, in approaching possible professional contacts, you should
let your research articles be your emissaries.  (If you haven't
written anything yet, let your networking wait until you have.
Unpublished articles, conference papers, and research reports are
all okay.  In writing your first articles, you will want to lean
heavily on your local system of advisors, mentors, and peers; the
skills involved in this process are a subject for another time.) </p><p>

Here is the procedure: (a) choose someone you wish to approach and
read their work with some care; (b) make sure that your article
cites their work in some substantial way (in addition to all your
other citations); (c) mail the person a copy of your article; and
(d) include a low-key, one-page cover letter that says something
intelligent about their work.  If your work and theirs could be
seen to overlap, include a concise statement of the relationship
you see between them.  The tone of this letter counts.  Project
ordinary, calm self-confidence.  Refrain from praising or fawning
or self-deprecation or cuteness or making a big deal out of it
-- you're not subordinating yourself to this person; you're just
passing along your paper.  Don't sound like you're presupposing or
demanding that you'll get a response.  Try a formula such as, "If
you should happen to have any comments, I would be most interested
to hear them".  A good final sentiment for your letter is, "Will you
be at such-and-such conference?". </p><p>

Don't drop dead if you don't get a response right away.  Anybody who
isn't egotistical will appreciate your taking the trouble to write
them.  Most people are thrilled to learn that someone understands
what they're saying.  If they don't reply, that's regrettable but it
just means they're busy.  The deep principle is that network-building
takes time.  It's a long-term investment.  You have to get your
name out there.  Keep taking the actions that I am describing,
and trust that your community will come together when it needs to.
The lack of an immediate response does not mean that nothing was
accomplished, and you should not read any meaning into it. </p><p>

In some countries, custom places great emphasis on "being introduced"
to someone.  That is, if you wish to meet with person X, you must
first convince a professional peer of X, let us say Y, to formally
introduce you at some professional gathering, or at least write you
some kind of letter of introduction.  While this procedure is harmless
enough in itself as a substitute for the kind of letter I described
above (provided that you have written a relevant paper along the lines
I also described above), I think it is most unfortunate when customs
actually <i>require</i> introductions.  The effect is to reproduce
social inequalities by making it difficult for anybody new to break
into the existing circle of professional contacts.  The procedure I
advocate may sound embarrassingly American, but it is also relatively
egalitarian. </p><p>

A few comments about the paper itself. </p><p>

Make sure you include full contact information on the front page.
That includes your mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, and
home page URL.  Be sure to mark the paper as a "draft" unless it has
been formally published, and put a date on it to distinguish different
versions. </p><p>

Double-check all of your quotations from other people's work.  It is
remarkably easy to get them wrong. </p><p>

Write a good abstract.  A bad abstract just announces a question
("topic X is important and I will say something about it"), but a good
abstract also answers the question by clearly stating the substance
of your new idea or discovery.  You may resist putting the bottom line
of your paper right there in the abstract; it feels like you're making
the paper redundant.  But don't worry; it only feels that way because
you know how the conclusion is arrived at. </p><p>

Do not use citations as a form of flattery.  This sort of thing fools
nobody.  Instead, think of a research paper as a kind of open letter,
with the people you cite included among its addressees.  The research
literature is a conversation, and your paper is a way of starting new
conversations with people in your area.  When in doubt, get advice.
</p><p>

In the old days, the article and letter you sent to approach someone
were both printed on paper.  Should you use electronic mail instead?
I actually recommend using paper.  At least you shouldn't use
electronic media just because they're modern.  For one thing, paper
is much easier to flip through quickly or to read on the subway.
It's also much easier to write comments on.  Use your judgement.
If you do decide to employ electronic mail for this purpose, use just
as much care as you would on paper.  Remember that first impressions
count.  And don't try to use e-mail for the get-to-know-you type of
chatting that should logically follow at this point.  Instead ... </p><p>

<strong> <a name="basic-meet"> (4) Meet each person face-to-face at a
professional meeting. </a> </strong> </p><p>

Research people normally go to great lengths to attend conferences
and other professional meetings, and computer networks are unlikely
to change this.  So submit papers to conferences.  Once you're at
a conference, by all means attend the talks that interest you.  But
spend most of your time tracking particular people down and talking
to them.  If your target is scheduled to speak, attend the talk, take
notes, brainstorm low-key questions and conversation topics, and then
introduce yourself as the crowd is breaking up, or in the break or
reception time afterward.  The person's talk will provide conversation
topics, and most people are more relaxed after their talk is over
anyway.  You shouldn't introduce yourself out of the blue by saying,
"I wrote you a letter, remember?", but you can gently refresh their
memory a moment or two into the discussion.  Unless you really
know what you're doing, you should keep the conversation to safe,
professional topics.  Ask questions about their work that you
genuinely want answered.  Ask them about the people they work with.
Figure out who you know (that is, professionally) in common.  Say
things like, "I hear that your school has started a new such-and-such
program; is that something you were involved in?", or "So-and-so
from your group joined our faculty recently; nice person, interesting
work".  If other people, projects, or laboratories come up in the
conversation, say whatever positive things you honestly have to say
about them -- avoid criticism and negativity. </p><p>

The most important project, once the discussion turns to matters of
professional and intellectual substance, is the articulation of shared
values, for example, "we both believe in using research to change the
world", or "we both believe in using both qualitative and quantitative
methods judiciously, without any a priori bias against either".
Shared values make for stronger professional bonds than shared ideas
or shared interests alone.  Don't rush into this, but do keep the
conversation focused on the concrete professional topics that will
provide raw materials for it.  On the other hand, if the conversation
doesn't seem to be going anywhere, that's not your fault.  Don't force
it.  Don't set enormous expectations for a single conversation.  It's
a long-term process.  Just say "nice chatting with you" in a pleasant
way and let it go.  If the interaction went well, you can end the
conversation by saying, "do you have a business card?" in a mildly
enthusiastic way (assuming you have one yourself); if they don't
have a card then shrug and let it go.  If the interaction leaves
you feeling bad, go get some fresh air, acknowledge the feelings,
and be nice to yourself.  Talk it out with someone if you need to.
Then carry on. </p><p>

If the person you wish to approach is significantly more powerful
than you then the prospect of conversing with him or her will probably
make you uneasy.  That's okay.  Concentrate on meeting people who
intimidate you less and your courage will grow.  Your single most
important audience is actually not the power-holders of your field
anyway, but rather the best people of your own professional cohort,
especially other graduate students and others who are a few years
further along than you.  These people share your situation and will
usually be happy to talk to you. </p><p>

I believe, notwithstanding all the talk about "virtual reality" and
"electronic communities", that electronic communication does not make
face-to-face interaction obsolete.  Instead, as I said at the outset,
you should think of e-mail and face-to-face interaction as part of a
larger ecology of communication media, each with its own role to play.
In particular, you do not really have a professional relationship
with someone until you have spoken with them face-to-face at length.
</p><p>

Having said that, the availability of e-mail will nonetheless bring
subtle changes to the ecology of communication in your field.  This
is particularly true with regard to the telephone, whose uses change
considerably in e-mail-intensive communities -- so much so, in fact,
that many people nearly stop using the phone altogether (or never
learn how) and try to use e-mail for unsuitable purposes like
asking discussion groups for information that could have been gotten
more easily through resources listed in the front of the phone book.
(It's amazing what you can accomplish over the telephone once you
learn how.  And long-distance really is not that expensive unless
you're planning to settle in for a long chat, which you usually
are not.)  But the role of face-to-face interaction will change
as well, particularly since many kinds of routine work can be
conducted almost as easily at a distance electronically as in formal
meetings face-to-face.  Electronic communication might even allow
face-to-face interaction to shift its balance from its practical
to its ritual functions.  In any case, the general lesson is to pay
attention to the relationships among media so you can use the right
tool for each job. </p><p>

One more note: when you go to a professional meeting, take a minute
to flip through your e-mail correspondence and make a list (ideally
on paper) of all the people you've "met" on-line who might attend
the conference.  Right before the meeting begins, recite all of the
names out loud to yourself so they'll be on the tip of your tongue.
Few things are more embarrassing than drawing a blank when someone at
a conference approaches you and tries to pick up a conversation begun
on e-mail. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="basic-exchange"> (5) Exchange drafts. </a> </strong>
</p><p>

Having made initial contacts with people, I'm afraid that the next
step depends on the hierarchy.  If someone is much more senior than
you, your goal is simply to get on their radar screen -- one chat
per year is plenty.  (That's mostly because they already have a full
network and have begun to reckon relevance differently from you.)
If someone you have met is more or less equal to you in the hierarchy,
and if they still strike you as relevant, worthwhile, and trustworthy,
it will probably be time to exchange pre-publication drafts of new
articles.  Again, keep it low-key: pass along a draft that you're
ready to circulate and invite "any comments you might have".  (Make
sure you've run your draft through a spelling checker first.) </p><p>

Upon receiving such a draft yourself, take the trouble to write out
a set of comments on it.  Make sure your comments are intelligent,
thoughtful, constructive, and useful.  And legible.  Good comments
include "so-and-so's work might be relevant here because ...", "I
can imagine a so-and-so arguing that you're wrong here because ...",
"I didn't understand what you meant by such-and-such; do you mean X,
or Y, or what?", "a possible counterexample here is ...", "another
question that might be interesting to discuss here is ...", "you
could take this analysis even further by talking about ...", "this
point could probably use more explanation because ...", "I found
the transition here to be jarring", "would it be correct to say that
you're arguing that ...?". </p><p>

If you are uncomfortable writing critical comments, frame them with
positive comments ("this is obviously an important topic and you've
made some valuable observations"), develop a lexicon of hedges
("I'm not clear on ...", "maybe"), emphasize what's possible instead
of what's wrong ("maybe you can build on this by ...", "perhaps you
can further clarify this by ..."), own your feelings and judgements
("my sense is that ...", "I had trouble with ...", "I couldn't figure
out whether you meant X or Y", "I'm worried about the assumption
that ...", "I think I disagree with this argument because ..."),
emphasize the audience ("I'm concerned that this particular audience
will perceive this as ...", "I think these readers might interpret
you as saying ..."), turn shortcomings into opportunities ("a topic
for future research here might be ..."), and keep to specifics ("how
does this step follow?" as opposed to "woolly and vague").  These
rhetorical devices may seem baroque at first; their purpose is to let
you express yourself honestly without fear of giving offense.  Indeed,
once you get used to these devices you may realize that you've spent
your whole professional life saying what you think you're supposed to
say instead of asking yourself what you really think and feel.  The
point, of course, is not to use the precise words I'm offering, but
rather to find words that work for you while serving the same general
purpose. </p><p>

Most of your comments will respond to local issues in the author's
paper.  When you get done with these local comments, but while the
issues are still fresh in your mind, it's good to take a step back.
Ask yourself, "what is the outstanding paper that's in here trying
to get out?".  Then explain to the author what this outstanding paper
is like, without of course implying that the paper isn't already
outstanding.  On a more mundane level, you might take a moment to
think of relevant references that the author hasn't cited. </p><p>

When you get someone else's comments on your draft, you should take
them seriously without regarding them as nonnegotiable demands.  When
they suggest that you change something, distinguish clearly in your
mind between the problem the commenter was having and the solution
they suggested.  If they saw a problem (grammar, logic, fogginess,
etc) then a problem probably does exist and you should probably fix it
in some way.  But their particular solution might not be the best one,
and you should not feel bound to adopt it.  In fact, the most common
error in using such comments is to follow them superficially, making
the changes that entail the least possible effort, without honestly
asking yourself what the underlying problem (if any) might be.  For
example, it will sometimes be clear that the reader misunderstood
something you wrote.  Their misconstrual will usually be offensively
absurd, and you may feel frustrated.  The solution to this problem is
not to send the commenter a message to set them straight, but rather
to figure out how a reasonable person, operating from a particular
background of assumptions, might misconstrue what you wrote in that
way -- and revise accordingly.  When you're revising a paper based on
such comments, try to formulate particular rules or themes or slogans
to define an agenda for improving your writing.  Identifying such an
agenda will make you more aware of potential problems in the future,
as well as motivating you to take some action about them, for example
by rereading Strunk and White's "Elements of Style" or Claire Kehrwald
Cook's fabulous and little-known copyediting book "Line by Line" one
more time. </p><p>

The ritual of meeting people and exchanging drafts is tremendously
important.  It's a shame, therefore, that nobody ever seems to teach
you how it's done.  When in doubt, ask for help.  And if somebody
comments a draft for you, thank them, include them in the paper's
acknowledgements, and be willing to reciprocate.  (You don't need to
make an explicit offer of reciprocation, though, any more than you
need to express your willingness to pass the salt -- it's understood.)
Doing so will cement a long-term professional relationship -- a new
member of your network.  What is more, having thoughtfully reflected
on others' comments on your work will help you to internalize their
voices.  That way, their voices will keep on talking to you during
later projects.  You will be smarter as a result, and you will have a
clearer and more realistic sense of who your audience is and how they
will react to your writing. </p><p>

Once again, you should decide whether to use paper or electronic
mail to exchange comments on drafts of articles.  I recommend using
electronic mail.  Read the paper once with a red pen, marking small
items and writing two-word marginal comments -- just enough to remind
you of your thoughts an hour later.  Having marked the superficial
problems, you may need to read the draft again with more weighty
questions in mind.  Again, simple comments in the margin will suffice.
Then, right away, before your thoughts fade, sit down at a computer
and type in a long e-mail message with all of the thoughts that
your two-word comments call back to mind.  Just keep typing until
you run out of red markings to explicate.  You will be amazed at how
much useful material you can generate in a short time.  Once you are
finished, toss the author's draft in the recycling bin.  The author
will miss out on some of your detailed copyediting, but you don't
want to take the risk that the author will misunderstand the cryptic
comments you wrote in the margin.  If you do decide to paper-mail the
marked-up draft to the author, put your name and phone number on it so
they can keep track of whose comments were whose. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="basic-follow"> (6) Follow up. </a> </strong> </p><p>

Keep coming up with simple ways to be useful to the people in your
network.  A few times a year is plenty.  Pass things along to them.
Mention their work to other people.  Plug them in your talks.  Include
them in things.  Get your department or laboratory to invite them to
speak.  Put them up when they come to town.  Write reviews of their
books.  And invent other helpful things to do.  None of this is
mandatory, of course, but it helps.  And I can't repeat this often
enough: keep it low-key.  Never, ever pressure anybody into anything.
Don't say "please" or "I know you must be very busy", which can sound
like emotional manipulation.  Don't heap so much unsolicited help on
someone that they feel crowded or obligated.  Don't complain.  Don't
approach the whole business as a matter of supplication and begging,
but rather as ordinary cooperation among equals.  Likewise, make sure
you're exchanging these favors out of courtesy and respect, and not as
phony politicking -- everyone hates that stuff.  Build relationships
with personal friends outside of work so you won't be unconsciously
trying to get professional contacts to play roles in your personal
life (for example, the role of sounding board for your troubles).
If you don't hear from someone for a while, let it ride.  If you feel
yourself getting obsessive about the process, go talk it out with
someone you regard as wise. </p><p>

Following up with people is one area where e-mail makes a qualitative
difference.  Once you've established a professional relationship
with someone, e-mail provides a convenient way to maintain a steady,
low-key background of useful two-way interactions.  You might wish to
forward things to people (abstracts, interesting messages, conference
announcements, press releases, book reviews, whatever) depending on
their interests.  Or you might wish to recommend their papers (in a
low-key way, with a concise summary and a complete citation, and only
if you really mean it) to e-mail discussion groups.  Don't overdo it,
and pay attention to whether the gesture is being reciprocated. </p><p>

After a (long) while you might consider building an electronic
mailing list of people who share your interests and would like to
get interesting stuff forwarded to them routinely -- including, of
course, your own abstracts and shorter papers.  Never add anybody
to such a list (or any list) without asking them, and never pressure
them or make a big deal out of it.  (And make it a real mailing list,
run on an automatic server that lets people subscribe and unsubscribe
automatically, rather than a long list of addresses that you send a
message to.  If you do have to send mail to a large number of people
at once, be sure to put their addresses in a Bcc: field, not in the
To: field where everyone will have to look at them.) </p><p>

E-mail is also obviously useful for a wide variety of other
purposes, for example scheduling and organizing professional events.
Make sure that some purpose is actually being served; don't engage
in professional e-mail correspondence simply for the sake of it. </p><p>

</p><h3> <strong> <a name="section3"> SECTION 3.  Building a Professional
Identity </a> </strong> </h3> <p>

So far I have been talking about networking at the one-to-one level.
That's where it starts.  But the research community is a public place,
and as you become established in your field, publishing in journals
and speaking at conferences, you will also develop an identity.  This
section describes some of the basics of building such an identity.
I call it a professional identity because its workings are governed by
the tacit rules of the research profession. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="conferences"> Socializing at conferences </a>
</strong> </p><p>

Sooner or later (hopefully sooner), you will start attending research
conferences in your field.  Section 2 has already discussed the
techniques for approaching someone at a conference that you have
already written to.  This section offers more suggestions for getting
the most from a conference. </p><p>

First, though, let me explain what a conference is.  Almost any
professional field will have one or more annual meetings, typically
three or four days in length, sponsored either by a professional
association or by an organization created specifically to host that
particular conference.  Most such meetings are held in a different
city each year, although some smaller meetings are held in specific
appealing places (e.g., Hawaii in January).  In recent years many
conferences have started gesturing toward globalization by (for
example) rotating between the United States and Europe.  Most
conferences, especially larger ones, are held in expensive downtown
convention hotels, for the simple reason that such hotels are the
only places where large numbers of out-of-towners can sleep.  At first
it might seem like a scam that everyone in your field gets to travel
to a different interesting city every year for a conference.  You'll
stop thinking that way, though, once you have been to a few dozen
conferences and gotten sick of traveling.  People's home institutions
are spread out, they have to meet somewhere, and so they might as
well meet someplace reasonably nice, hopefully with good airline
connections.  They'll be spending most of their time in homogenized
airports and hotels anyway, so it's not like a trip to a resort. </p><p>

The fundamental purpose of professional conferences is networking.
Everyone in your field has a professional network, just like you.
They built their networks the same way you are, and they attend
conferences to keep their networks in working order.  In the old days,
before the Internet, conferences were also occasions when committees
would meet, for example to edit journals or plan future conferences.
That does still happen to a degree, but e-mail and the Web have
moved most such logistical matters online, leaving the more ceremonial
functions to face-to-face conference interactions.  Conferences are
also occasions to publicize your work, although that function can
hardly be dissociated from networking, and they are places for the
job market.  Some conferences have evolved rituals for interviewing
job candidates in hotel rooms; others simply provide hunting grounds
for advanced graduate students to network with senior scholars whose
departments are likely to be hiring.  For all of these reasons, you
should attend conferences, and take them seriously as professional
occasions, as soon as you have research that's ready to report. </p><p>

Although each field has its own practices, as a broad generalization
conferences accept papers in two different ways: either you submit
your paper (or perhaps an abstract) as an individual, or else you join
a coherent "panel" of papers that are submitted to the conference as
a group.  In either case the program committee somehow decides which
papers get accepted.  You should find out which practices obtain at
the conferences you hope to attend, and plan accordingly.  If the
conference only accepts panel proposals, it would not be excessively
presumptuous of you to start organizing a panel yourself.  You might
discover that the people you approach are already putting panels
together, in which case they might (or might not) include you in their
planning.  This process can get a little bit clumsy, but don't worry
about it. </p><p>

If the conference takes individual paper submissions, then you should
seek detailed advice about the politics of the process.  For example,
some conferences require you to provide a few keywords on the title
page so that the program committee can route your paper to the
most suitable referees.  Obviously you want to include the keywords
that get your paper routed to the referees who are most likely to
appreciate your work's virtues, and only your faculty advisors can
tell you what those keywords are likely to be.  (You should find out
whether the conference is formally refereed, meaning that the program
committee recruits people to actually write comments on each paper,
accepting some and rejecting others.  Formally refereed conference
papers are more valuable in career terms than papers that were handled
more informally.)  Papers that are accepted individually will usually
then be grouped into panels by the program committee, so that the
program will list your paper alongside a few other people's, and
responsibility for convening the panel will be assigned to a panel
chair, most likely a regular conference attendee whom the program
committee has drafted for the job. </p><p>

Some conferences distinguish between papers and posters.  A paper
is something that you present in front of an audience, at a set
time, with a microphone and audio-visual aids.  Posters, on the other
hand, are grouped into one big room.  You'll be given a bulletin board
of a set size, and you'll be asked to prepare a poster that can be
tacked up on the board.  Conference attendees will be able to browse
through the posters, and certain times will be advertised when poster
authors are asked to be available alongside their posters to chat with
passers-by.  A poster is a lower-status form of presentation than a
talk, but no stigma attaches to it, and you shouldn't be embarrassed
to prepare a poster.  Once you get over the feeling that you're a
salesperson waiting on customers in a shop, it can be a more relaxed
way to talk to people individually than the crush after a panel is
over.  If you do prepare a poster, take the time to do it right, with
appealing and legible graphics. </p><p>

Conferences cost money.  Most conferences have discounted student
rates, which you might even be able to afford.  Many conferences offer
free registration for students who are willing to engage in menial
jobs such as staffing the registration desk, and you should go ahead
and accept such deals unless it offends your pride.  There might be a
Web page for students looking for other students to share hotel rooms
with, or perhaps you can establish such a page yourself.  If you are
getting ready to go on the job market then you should guilt-trip your
thesis advisor into paying your airfare to the conference, or at least
make sure to write travel money into the relevant grant proposal well
ahead of time. </p><p>

Here, finally, is the promised advice for socializing at conferences,
partly adapted from notes by Dan Ryan. </p><p>

Many conferences are preceded by smaller one- or two-day workshops;
these events will usually provide a more focused and comfortable
occasion for mixing with people than the larger conference.  It
is much easier to approach someone at random during such an event,
something that tends to work poorly in a crowded conference setting.
</p><p>

Stay in the main conference hotel if at all possible; when you check
in, locate the fitness center, if any, and the nearest good breakfast
place.  Study the conference schedule to determine which talks you'll
be attending, and find out in advance where the meeting rooms are.
You'll be happier if you don't look lost.  Go find the room where you
will be speaking and check it out.  Find a moment when nobody is using
the room, stand at the speaker's podium, and get used to the energy.
</p><p>

Once the event gets rolling, act like a host.  Introduce people to
one another, include them in things, and notice when they are feeling
bad or being oppressed.  Hunt for the person who is chairing the panel
that you are speaking on. </p><p>

When your talk comes, keep it simple.  Practice your talk several
times in realistic conditions before traveling to the conference, so
you can be confident of doing well when the time comes. </p><p>

If you aren't accustomed to speaking with a microphone, take a moment
to do it right.  If the room has an audio technician, ask if you can
get a cordless lapel mike, which is much less constraining than a mike
that is mounted on a podium.  Refuse to use a headset or a hand-held
mike, which are only for experienced performers.  If you must use
a podium mike, you can avoid looking like a fool by stopping briefly
to familiarize yourself with its on-off button.  If you are the first
speaker in a session to use the mike, check the sound level ("can you
hear me?") before you launch into your talk.  If you are seated at a
table with the mike on a stand in front of you, resist the temptation
to press your mouth right up against it.  You don't want the mike
directly in front of your mouth, since the wind from your sibilants
(s-sounds) and plosives (p-sounds) will make a roaring sound in the
speakers.  Sound travels in all directions, not just straight out of
your mouth, so put the microphone just below your mouth.  That will
also help people to see your face.  If you have problems with the
microphone, don't be shy about stopping to get help.  It happens all
the time. </p><p>

The chair of your session should tell you in advance how long to speak
for.  If not then ask.  Try to finish on time.  But if your talk runs
more than a minute over your allotted time, suppress the overwhelming
urge to race through the rest of it at 100mph.  Don't be one of those
people who says "in conclusion" but keeps on talking.  Instead, just
give up.  Shrug and say, "oops, well, I've gone over time so I'll just
stop here; I have the full paper here if anyone wants it", and then
briefly remind everyone what your bottom-line conclusion is.  Everyone
will be impressed at your poise. </p><p>

After all the panel members' talks are over, a question period
typically follows, with audience members specifying which speakers
their questions are addressed to.  Don't worry if you aren't asked
any questions; questioners are often drawn to the most provocative
comments, and provocation doesn't imply quality.  If you are asked
a question, resist the temptation to launch into a long speech that
explains all of your intricate thinking from the beginning.  If the
question has a short, conclusory answer (such as "yes" or "no"), say
the short answer first.  Having said the short answer, you might find
that the long answer becomes shorter as well. </p><p>

When your panel is over, hang around for a few minutes in case anybody
wants to chat.  Bring business cards to exchange (but, as the speaker,
don't offer anyone a card unless they offer a card to you).  Affect
a calm, low-key demeanor and ask them, with genuine interest, "are you
working in this area as well?".  When you're done, go get some fresh
air. </p><p>

Relax.  Take care of yourself.  Breathe.  Drink water.  Buy a
book.  Don't drink coffee.  Don't eat junk food.  Rarely pass up an
opportunity to go out with a group to eat.  If you run out of things
to do, go figure out who the smartest people at the conference are,
especially the more human and less established ones, so you can start
promoting their work. </p><p>

If you have a laptop computer, consider typing in a straightforward
narrative account of the ideas presented at the conference; after
the conference is done, you can help others by editing this narrative
for clarity and sending it to a mailing list of people in your field.
This is a low-effort way to help the community and get your name out.
</p><p>

Start imagining yourself into the role of conference organizer by
consciously noting aspects of the conference that are especially well-
or poorly-organized. </p><p>

Some technically advanced conferences have created Web-based systems
for helping attendees connect with each other and schedule their time
before the meeting even begins; advocate that such a system be built
for any conference that you might be involved in organizing. </p><p>

The most basic skill for attending conferences is talking to other
researchers about your work.  They will ask you, "What do you work
on?", and you need to be able to answer this question any time, to
anyone, at any length.  This is amazingly hard, and you may end up
kicking yourself at your stammering non-answers.  That's fine; it's
part of the process.  You should rehearse answers to this question
before attending conferences.  Your local research group may not
be helpful; since they already know what you're working and share all
of your assumptions, you rarely need to explain yourself at a basic
level to them.  Try practicing ten-second explanations, one-minute
explanations, five-minute explanations, and so on, up to a full-length
talk. </p><p>

The hardest part is tailoring your explanation to your audience, and
this is an area where you should invest sustained, structured effort.
Do you remember when you were in the library, identifying researchers
whose work was related to yours in various directions?  This is
similar.  Try to avoid explaining your work to a complete stranger.
Instead, get them to talk first.  And while they are talking, work to
articulate specific elements that your respective research interests
share in common.  (By the way, the phrase "I am interested in ..."
actually means "I am conducting research on ...".)  Perhaps you both
employ qualitative research methods.  Perhaps you are both doing
comparative work.  Perhaps you both have a political agenda, even if
maybe not the same one.  Perhaps you are both studying the history of
a certain region, or a certain century, or a certain industry, even if
other elements of your research topics are different.  Perhaps you are
both aiming your work at industrial applications.  With practice, you
will begin to spot the commonalities at a greater distance. </p><p>

Once you have identified the commonalities between your two projects,
fashion an explanation of your own project that puts the common
elements in the foreground and leaves the other elements in the
background.  For example, if you are using economic theories to
study the Mongolians, and the other person is using cultural theories
to study the Mongolians, put the Mongolians in the foreground;
explain what sources of evidence you're using, what particular people
and places you're looking at, and so on, and then mention along
the way that you're using some economic ideas to look at those things.
On the other hand, if you are using economic theories to study the
Mongolians, and the other person is using economic theories to study
the Japanese, put the economic theories in the foreground.  Explain
what theoretical authors you are drawing on, what methods you are
using, what big economic questions you're hoping to help answer, and
so on, and then mention along the way that your case study happens to
be drawn from the Mongolians. </p><p>

This strategy of foregrounding shared elements might seem weird at
first; it might even seem manipulative or phony, as if there were one
single authentic answer to the question "What are you working on?"
and all the other answers are artificial.  But that's not how it
works.  The answers that you construct for people from unfamiliar
backgrounds will certainly feel unfamiliar.  But if they are
honest representations of your work then they are good, informative,
relationship-building answers.  Once you get some practice consciously
constructing explanations of your work for many sorts of people, you
will begin adjusting your explanations automatically, and the sense of
weirdness and fakeness will dissipate.

traveling to face-to-face meetings </a> </strong> </p><p>

The Internet helps people at far-flung or ill-funded universities to
keep their hand in the research world.  Here are some guidelines: </p><p>

 * Follow the basic six-step outline I described above, more or
less omitting the steps that involve face-to-face contact.  This
is better than trying to undertake those steps using e-mail, since
e-mail really is not very good at some things. </p><p>

 * Correspond.  Spend lots of time writing intelligent, thoughtful
letters to people about their manuscripts and papers, along the
lines I've described. </p><p>

 * Translate.  If the major language of your country is not English,
but you are corresponding with authors who <i>do</i> write in English,
consider translating short papers that provide introductions to
their work.  This is a good way to build professional relationships,
as well as bridges between different intellectual cultures. </p><p>

 * Publish.  And then make it a priority to get reprints into the
hands of people who might be interested in them.  If postage is a
problem, make a postscript file (or preferably several different
formats, since not everyone can translate postscript) available on
a Web site or ftp server. </p><p>

 * Join the conversation.  You might be isolated geographically,
but you don't have to isolate yourself intellectually.  Make sure
that your letters and papers are part of a conversation.  That
is, formulate your professional papers as responses to the existing
literature, and to particular contributors to that literature, and
make clear the nature of your debts to those authors and the nature
of your own contribution.  If you're not clear how this is done, use
existing papers as a model. </p><p>

 * Relentlessly promote your own work.  Mention your ideas and
publications in messages to appropriate electronic discussion groups.
But always keep it low-key.  No fanfare, no hype, no big claims.
Cultivate an attitude of quiet, confident intellectual seriousness,
and then consciously and carefully project that image. </p><p>

 * Make yourself useful.  When you read something you genuinely
respect, send a brief review and recommendation to the appropriate
discussion groups.  Pass along useful items you encounter on the
net.  Invent some useful network facility, if only an annotated
bibliography or guide to resources. </p><p>

 * Be systematic.  Once you've gotten accustomed to the whole
process of networking, take a few days out to search all available
resources, both on the network and on paper, and make list of all
of the people you want to approach using the six-step process and
all of the e-mail discussion groups you want to publicize your work
on.  Then slowly and systematically, over several months or a year,
approach them all.  The process takes lots of time, but it does work.
</p><p>

 * Keep trying to raise travel funds.  The professional contacts
you develop on the net ought to be able to help with this, since the
world is full of international travel grants and exchange programs
that are relatively easy to set up once you have willing parties
on both ends.  But wait until you have a fairly strong relationship
going before you try this. </p><p>

 * Make your travel count.  Don't spend your hard-earned money on
travel unless you're going someplace where you can meet with several
people you already "know", if only through e-mail correspondence and
the networking process explained above.  Unless you're an unusually
sociable or charismatic person, don't attend a conference in the
abstract hope that you'll meet someone useful there. </p><p>

 * Share your experience.  Help build the electronic networking
community by getting involved in Local Civic Networks and the like.
Reach out to people in your area whose interests in computer networks
might be different from yours, and do some community-building among
them.  Reflect on how your relatively marginal position in the world's
research system conditions your work and your life.  Write down your
experiences and advice for the benefit of others. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="publication"> Publication and credit </a> </strong>
</p><p>

Another dimension of the institutional structuring of professional
relationships pertains to credit.  If you do something new, you ought
to get credit for it.  Credit resembles money in the sense that you
can "buy" certain things with it -- for example further research
funding.  (Credit for this observation, for instance, belongs to Bruno
Latour and Steve Woolgar in their book, "Laboratory Life".)  Credit
can also be understood as an informal type of intellectual property.
A research paper resembles a patent application, which is always drawn
as widely as possible, consistent with the actual accomplishments of
the work and being careful not to trample any prior art.  But credit
differs from money and property in other ways.  The most important
of these is that nobody is keeping an objective ledger of who gets
credit for what; it's much more an evolving consensus that only
becomes formalized years after the fact.  Many people get neurotic
about credit and invest tremendous effort trying to manipulate others
into giving them the credit they think they're due.  But the actual
keys to getting due credit for your work are simple.  The first is
to publish promptly.  When you do something good, write about it and
get it out there.  And the second is to do your networking.  I have
already explained one reason why writing helps with networking -- it
gives you something to talk about.  A second reason is that if you
talk about your work without having circulated it in written form
then you will be (perhaps justifiably) paranoid that someone else
will (perhaps innocently) publicize your idea before you and therefore
get the credit for it.  Don't get yourself into this demoralizing
rut.  And understand where the danger comes from: when two people
are doing research in the same area, their relationship is inevitably
structured by a tension between a natural alliance (helping one
another, organizing things together, jointly publicizing the shared
area of research) and natural competition (over credit for new ideas).
This tension will be much easier to manage if you continually put
sane amounts of effort into both your writing and your networking.
</p><p>

When you do publish your work, where should you publish it?  Two
errors are common.  One error is to choose your publication venues
reactively by simply publishing in the places where someone in
your network happens to invite you to publish -- for example, in
a book that this person might be editing.  While accepting such
invitations might actually be a good idea, don't let invitations
drive your publication strategy.  Instead, talk to people who
are knowledgeable, hit the library, map out all of the potentially
relevant publications, and make conscious decisions.  This leads us
to the second common error, which is to get obsessed with publishing
in the "good places".  Lots of people get preoccupied with ranking
journals, so that publication turns into a zero-sum status game.
This is most unfortunate.  It is much better, in my view, to think
about publication choices in terms of professional relationships.
A journal is not just a badge of rank.  Much more importantly,
it is a gathering-place for a particular community of people, namely
the professionals in that field who read it.  When you publish
in a particular journal, you are doing two things: (1) you are
representing yourself as being relevant to such-and-such a research
community, and (2) you are introducing yourself to that community
and inviting them to get to know you.  So instead of asking,
"where is the high-prestige place to publish", ask "who would I
like to associate with professionally?".  That makes the decision
much easier.  If you don't know what sorts of people read a given
journal, you can always ask.  Most likely you will get different
answers from different people, according to their own relationships
to that journal's readership, but that's alright.  Just decide who
you believe and carry on. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="intellectual"> Intellectual leadership </a>
</strong> </p><p>

The steps for making contact with people that I've been describing
obviously do not exhaust the social skills that are necessary to get
along in the professional world of research.  But they do provide
a necessary foundation -- the basic strokes of the professional
combustion engine.  Having gotten your network going in this way,
the obvious question is what to do with it.  Well, maybe you do
nothing with it.  Having people to talk to about your research might
be plenty.  But if you'd like to do good in your field, or do well
in it, or both, you'll want to try organizing something: a workshop,
a journal issue, an e-mail discussion list, an approach to a funding
agency, or whatever.  Later sections will discuss these activities
in more detail.  Right now I want to introduce two important concepts
related to them: "emerging themes" and "consultation". </p><p>

Most everyone regards the notion of an "emerging theme" as hype,
and no doubt I will be thought cynical for explaining it, but it's
tremendously important anyway.  Research, of course, is about new
ideas -- and not just individual new results, but whole new fields of
research and whole new ways of doing research in a given area.  New
ways of doing research rarely spring full-blown from any individual's
head.  Rather, somebody who has been keeping up with many different
research projects starts to notice a trend -- a direction in which a
substantial number of research projects are all headed.  Perhaps it's
a previously unnoticed analogy among various new concepts; perhaps
it's a metaphor that makes sense out of a range of seemingly unrelated
results; perhaps it's a pattern that appears to underlie the work
of several different groups; perhaps it's a method from another field
that several groups have been importing into their own field and have
independently found useful or necessary; or perhaps it is a widely
shared dissatisfaction with the old intellectual frameworks that is
now starting to take form as a new framework.  If you want examples,
simply look at the titles and introductions to any edited book, any
special issue of a journal, or any workshop.  Fame and fortune justly
attach to the people who notice such things, put names on them, and
gather together the people whose research appears to fall within them.
These people are the shamans; their role is not to create something
out of nothing, but to help the community become conscious of new
understandings that have been taking form below the surface.  Such
people have four qualities: (1) their own research is an instance
of the patterns they are noticing (unfortunately, this is usually a
prerequisite to being taken seriously in the role of pattern-seeker),
(2) they care enough to actually think about other people's research
(this quality is in short supply, thus creating abundant opportunities
for those who possess it), (3) they communicate intensively enough
with other people to actually keep up-to-date with them (this is where
e-mail helps), and (4) they are smart enough to notice the patterns
in the first place (this is sometimes the least important factor).
You can work wonders if you cultivate these qualities. </p><p>

As a practical matter, you'll work these wonders through consultation.
Research people, especially in academia, generally insist on being
consulted beforehand on any matter that affects them.  Consultation
is the fundamental protocol of all academic life -- both within
institutions and within disciplines.  So, for example, if you have
noticed a hot new theme emerging from the research in your area, you
should not immediately announce a workshop or a mailing list on the
topic and expect people to flock to it.  (In general, never try to
organize a group activity just because you think, in an abstract way,
that it would be a nice idea.  It doesn't work that way.)  Instead,
you should decide who the affected parties are and communicate with
them.  One way to get started on this is to write a (short or long)
survey paper that describes the pattern you see emerging, puts a name
on it, sketches in a sympathetic way how various projects (your own
and others') seem to fit within it, explains what can be learned by
looking at things this way, extracts a set of axioms or principles
or methods or organizing concepts, and outlines some suggested lines
of future research.  Another approach is simply to write a paper
that explains your own research in terms of the emerging pattern and
then, as a secondary matter, explains how the other projects fit in.
And a third approach is to attempt to organize a workshop or other
small-scale professional meeting around the theme you've begun to
articulate. </p><p>

To do this, write a draft announcement for the meeting that explains
its unifying concept -- the emerging theme.  Clearly label it
as a draft.  Then -- and this is consultation -- send this draft
<i>individually</i> to each of the ten people whose participation in
the meeting is crucial.  Include a cover letter/message soliciting
their perspectives and their guidance.  (The phrase "I'd like to
ask your advice" causes miracles the world over.)  Ask them if they
think the time would be ripe for such a meeting, and ask them if you
have articulated the emerging theme in the best way.  Do not present
anything as a fait accompli.  When you get responses back from these
people, take the responses seriously.  Modify your draft to take them
all into account.  Rewrite it from scratch if necessary.  Get lots
of advice and really listen to it (even if you don't follow it).  You
will probably fail at this process once or twice before you succeed,
but more importantly you'll learn what it's like to internalize
other people's opinions -- the basic mechanism of socialization
into a community.  And remember that consultation, like most things,
works much better if you have gone through the six network-building
steps I've described above, at least with a majority of the people
involved. </p><p>

This whole consultation process probably sounds like a lot of work.
Many people even regard it as a thankless sort of "dues" that they
must pay to their field.  This is not so.  Engaging in consultation
is a powerful act.  It changes your whole way of seeing the world.
You learn to notice the conditions that make action possible, and
you become able to internalize others' thinking without giving them
power over you.  As a result, a whole landscape of possibilities will
become visible before you -- a landscape that most people never see. 
It is a good idea, therefore, to organize professional activities
in your field.  It does require a lot of initiative, but it does not
necessarily require a vast amount of work.  The key is to delegate.
If you are willing to lead -- that is, to take the initiative to
define, consult, oversee, subdivide, and keep track -- then lots
of people will be willing to take responsibility for one piece of
the larger whole.  If this <i>doesn't</i> happen -- that is, if you
<i>can't</i> get people to commit to narrowly defined jobs -- then
that's a sign that you have misjudged how much energy really exists
around the theme you have identified.  Either rework that theme
through another round of consultation or simply abandon the whole
project and write down the lessons you've learned from it.  Don't
force something to happen if it just won't.  Lots of good ideas will
never happen; your job is to find the ones that <i>can</i> happen.
</p><p>

When a new theme does emerge to organize the research of a community,
often someone will complain that they had articulated that theme
themselves some years before.  Usually, however, that person had
not done the hard work of talking to everyone, internalizing their
perspectives, and building consensus around a particular formulation
of the theme.  That is what I am encouraging you to do. </p><p>

Having identified an emerging theme and organized a meeting of the
community around it, the next step might be to edit a book.  You
may not think of yourself as the sort of person who does book deals
with publishers, but it's not that hard.  Here is a simple method.
Identify a senior member of the emerging community who is decent
and well-connected, with whom you have good rapport and who would
be regarded as an honest broker by everyone involved.  Approach that
person and say this:

</p><blockquote>
I'm thinking it be might time for an edited book about this
emerging theme.  Here's a rough draft of a proposal for the book.
Likely chapter contributors would be A, B, C, D, and E.  I'd like
to propose that we edit the book together.  If you can help with
the diplomacy of recruiting the authors then I will do all of the
logistics.
</blockquote>

Don't use those exact words; hopefully you'll know this person well
enough by now to find words that are comfortable for you.  In any
case, you have just signed up for a lot of work: iterating drafts
of the proposal through consultation with the most important authors,
dealing with the publisher and copyeditor, keeping track of all the
manuscripts, sending reminders, cajoling people to offer comments
on one another's draft chapters, drafting an introduction to the
volume, writing your own chapter, preparing the index, managing
your overcommitted coeditor, and fighting the half-dozen fires that
will erupt along the way.  It's work, but it's worthwhile.  If you
go through this cycle even once then you will truly understand how 
the world around you works.  You will also have a book on your vita.
Of course, you won't know how to do much of the work you've signed up
for.  How, for example, do you find a publisher?  Asking advice from
the people in your network is part of the process.  If you take the
initiative, and if your emerging theme has enough energy behind it,
then people will be happy to help. <p>

That being said, here is some more advice for would-be book editors.
You should organize the project in a loose way, for the simple reason
that one or more of your chapter contributors may flake out on you.
Everyone from the publisher to the people who review your book for
academic journals will insist that all of the chapters fit together
to make a coherent whole, and this is a good ideal to the extent that
it is practical.  Don't try to organize an edited book unless you do
honestly think that the chapters will work together.  But make sure
that the book will still work if one or more of the chapters fails
to materialize.  Realize, too, that some people can't write, or can't
make deadlines.  One reason to build your network is that you can find
out ahead of time which potential authors are good to work with in
these ways, and which ones will cause you a lot of headaches for very
little payoff.  When you discuss the project with a publisher (or,
more precisely, an acquisitions editor who works for a publisher),
keep in mind that publishers only eat when they sell books.  As a
result, they always have a mental calculator going in their heads
that tells them how many copies of your book they can sell.  You
can't trick these people, so have an honest conversation with them
about how the book works as a business proposition.  Who would
buy it?  Publishers are generally unenthusiastic about edited books
these days, in part because they are less likely to be reviewed by
large-circulation magazines and journals, much less newspapers.  So
you have to make a clear case that your project has a lot of social
energy behind it, and that the topic you have identified is right on
the verge of exploding into a major intellectual movement of the sort
that sells books.  Most academics find it hard to think in business
terms about their publishing projects, so swallow your pride and let
the publisher instruct you in the matter.  Maybe a project or two will
fail before you learn to see the world through the publisher's eyes.
</p><p>

If the book project goes forward, you'll be negotiating a contract
with the publisher.  Don't make it complicated.  An academic
publisher won't be making much money on your edited book, and you're
probably not famous enough to be negotiating for special terms.
The only hard question you'll face is how to distribute the royalties.
Should the people who contribute chapters get any of the money?
How much?  It is common not to mention money when dealing with the
chapter authors, so that the book editors pocket it all.  This is
not an unreasonable procedure given the work that's involved, and
the publisher may not want to deal with the complexity of paying a
percentage royalty to each chapter author anyway.  Another approach
that's a little more fair is to pay each chapter author a fixed
honorarium that's basically a share of an advance.  In most cases,
however, you'll find that the authors are surprised to be getting
anything.  So don't worry too much about it. </p><p>

When you do build your professional network and identify your first
emerging theme, a voice in your head may tell you something like,
"well, if you thought of it then it must be obvious; surely you are
the last to know".  And since the task of initiating activities such
as the ones I've described can look like a steep mountain when you're
doing it for the first time, you might be tempted to assume that it's
not worth the trouble.  You'll think, surely someone else will beat me
to it.  When you hear these voices in your head, pay close attention
to them.  They don't want you to succeed professionally.  Why?  Are
they trying to protect you from the pain of failure?  Or do they just
think that you've been destined to fail since they day you were born?
The fact is, if you've built your professional network, and if someone
in that network already has activities under way around the emerging
theme that you have identified, then you are likely to have heard
about it already.  Of course, as you progress with your organizing you
might learn about other activities that are related to yours in one
way or another.  In rare cases an existing activity will render yours
redundant.  It happens.  But much more often, the existing activities
will be off at an angle from yours.  In that case, you will want to
have a friendly conversation with the people who are organizing them.
Perhaps you will decide to join forces, or perhaps you will articulate
the way in which your respective activities are complementary.  (You
will find that "complementary" is a useful word.)  You can then decide
whether and how to redesign your activity to bring out more clearly
its unique contribution. </p><p>

Those, then, are some of the rudiments of intellectual leadership.
(I will return to the subject later on.)  Many people don't want
to be leaders because they associate leadership with abuses of power.
It's true, many leaders do abuse power, and if you lead then you will
acquire power that you will be tempted to abuse.  But real leadership
does not require you to manipulate people, and a community of
well-informed and confident people cannot be manipulated.  So even if
you can't imagine yourself as a leader, I hope that you will organize
something, just once, so you'll understand how it works.  Focus on
articulating shared values and you'll be fine. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="norms"> Norms of humility </a> </strong> </p><p>

I have been advising you to promote your research and take a position
of leadership in your field.  Many people flat-out refuse my advice,
however, on the grounds that self-promotion is either inadvisable or
literally wrong.  Those people are not entirely mistaken.  They are
referring, on one level or another, to the norms of humility that
operate in most areas of social life.  Suppose that you stood up in
public and said, "I am exceedingly intelligent" or "my research is
of very high quality".  The audience would be incredulous, and would
openly treat you as a jerk.  Even otherwise pleasant people can become
quite nasty when you violate these unwritten rules.  Norms of humility
thus place extensive constraints on your public persona, and you will
have to learn an elaborate phraseology before you can engage at all
effectively in professional conversations. </p><p>

Here, then are the phrases that you need: </p><p>

 * Say "we" rather than "I", as in "we discovered such-and-such".
"We" can refer to your research group, or to the people who have
joined themselves into a particular workshop or intellectual movement.
</p><p>

 * Mitigate your expressions of opinion by saying things like, "I
personally think that ...", owning your opinions rather than asserting
them as truth. </p><p>

 * Give credit to others.  In explaining this article, for example, I
typically say that "NotN includes good advice accumulated from dozens
of people over many years, and I want to get it into the hands of
every PhD student in the world".  This statement is true -- NotN does
include advice accumulated from dozens of people, etc.  I could have
emphasized my own originality, but what purpose would that serve? </p><p>

 * Don't crow about your successes.  Yes, of course your paper
made a big splash at the last conference.  But why talk about it?
The success will speak for itself, especially with the people whose
opinion you most care about. </p><p>

 * Deflect praise.  If someone says something positive about you and
your work, you should calmly take the first opportunity to acknowledge
it.  Say this: "I appreciate the kind words".  Or this: "Whether my
work has such-and-such merits you've mentioned is for other people to
decide".  Notice that these formulas are mandatory: if someone praises
your work in your presence, and you don't deflect the praise, it is
as though you uttered the praise yourself.  Strange but true.  So you
should not let any praise go by without deflecting it. </p><p>

 * Emphasize the intellectual reasons for your work, not the personal
reasons.  If someone asks you, for example, why you chose a certain
direction in your research, you probably know enough not to say,
"so I can get tenure".  Instead, your answer should refer honestly
to the way in which research such as yours might hope to make the
world a better place.  Have such answers already rehearsed so that
they will be ready when the time comes.  The commonalities that you
have articulated in your conversations with others will help a lot.
</p><p>

 * Recognize that some social puzzles have no good answers.  If
you are invited to a conference that you just don't find worthwhile,
or are invited to a collaboration with someone who you just don't
respect, then you are stuck.  You don't want to say yes, you don't
have any honest way to say no without making yourself seem superior,
and you don't want to lie.  "I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't" is
probably the best you can do. </p><p>

As you evolve a professional persona, you will learn many formulas
like these, each of them adapted to a recurring problem of
professional life.  In each case, you will have to struggle with
the feeling that you are being fake.  Listen to the formulas that
other people use in similar situations, and do the best you can.
</p><p>

<strong> <a name="recognizing"> Recognizing difference </a> </strong>
</p><p>

These concepts, I hope, further illuminate the complex structure
of professional relationships within the institutions of research.
As with any social system, the point is not that some infinite power
imposes this structure on us from the outside, but rather that we
recreate the structure ourselves every time we interact with another
person.  And these numerous local accomplishments are all the more
remarkable given that, structures and systems notwithstanding,
people really are different from one another.  If you are carrying
around an overly rigid view of institutions and their workings
(say, for example, the view you probably got from your experiences
of undergraduate education) then you might not even notice the real
and rewarding work of exploring the differences between yourself and
your professional acquaintances.  The skills of recognizing human
difference -- not in the abstract, but concretely, within particular
interactions and particular relationships -- are growing more
important as research communities in all fields lose their national
and cultural boundaries. </p><p>

A common mistake is (usually unconsciously) to use networking skills
to seek out people who seem identical to you, either by ignoring the
differences, putting easy labels on the differences, or blowing the
differences out of all proportion.  This might have worked alright
when research worlds were heavily segregated by gender, culture,
discipline, research "school", and everything else, but it doesn't
work now.  Just about everyone is being forced, for example, to
reflect on different national traditions' remarkably different ideas
about the relationship between theory and evidence.  And we are
likewise learning to develop professional relationships with people
who don't already speak the same disciplinary language that we do --
it no longer suffices to detect potential allies simply because they
talk the same way.  Nobody yet knows how the practices of professional
networking might evolve under the pressure of these increasingly
prevalent types of professional difference.  My sense, though, is
that e-mail is poorly suited for the initial stages of establishing
a shared context for discussion between people with different cultural
or disciplinary backgrounds.  If this is true then my emphasis on
careful mixing of electronic and face-to-face communication takes on
new importance. </p><p>

A problem that often arises when talking with someone from a different
intellectual tradition involves "results".  What counts as a "result"
in your field?  A theorem?  A policy prescription?  An experimental
outcome?  A newly theorized concept?  As you start talking to people,
you will be surprised to discover just how diverse the various fields'
conceptions of a "result" can be.  People who have been socialized
into a given school of thought will habitually search anything they
read for the specific type of "result" that they are accustomed to.
Even neighboring subfields of the same intellectual tendency within
the supposedly same field can fail to communicate because they are
trying to discover incompatible types of "results" in one another's
work.  This failure of communication can be calamitous.  Each side
may perceive the other to be doing poor work -- or, literally, no
work at all.  They may even accuse one another of <i>hiding</i> their
conclusions.  Emotions may become strong, and serious conflict may
result.  In many cases the conflict will be ongoing, and (sub)fields
may have developed elaborate and nasty stereotypes of one another.
These stereotypes can be hard to puncture because they are expressed
in the metatheoretical shorthand that each field has developed for
its own discussions.  The neighboring (sub)field, for example, may be
said to have "no ideas", where the word "idea" has acquired a complex
history of unarticulated baggage that automatically rules out anything
that does not fit that particular group's ways of working and talking.
Or, to take another example at random, qualitative fieldwork methods
might be disparaged as "anecdotes that don't really prove anything"
-- not a good way to think if you're going to start a professional
relationship with an anthropologist!  Needless to say, you'll want
to anticipate this problem and defuse it before it damages anyone's
reputation or messes up a potential relationship.  This may require
you to overcome your own disciplinary socialization, which has almost
certainly included a lot of taken-for-granted invidious distinctions
that mark certain "others" as intellectual barbarians. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="final"> Getting a public voice </a> </strong> </p><p>

Although the institutions of research tend to focus your attention on
the other researchers in your field, your research interests probably
have a broader importance to society.  (I realize that some parts of
mathematics can't be explained to a general audience.  But that's the
exception.)  As you develop your professional voice, I hope you will
also consider developing a public voice, that is, a voice that normal
people outside your research community can understand.  This includes
speaking to community groups, writing for newspapers and magazines,
being interviewed by the media, testifying in legislative hearings,
circulating commentaries to a broad audience on the Internet, or
simply being able to discuss your field with normal people in social
situations. </p><p>

Some of these situations are relatively tractable.  For example,
if you announce a discovery and a science reporter asks you to
explain it, you will probably be able to find plain language for
it.  That situation is relatively easy because it's your own personal
research topic.  You've promised that you'll make it interesting,
a professional reporter has decided that you'll succeed, and you
give more or less the same speech that you give to people informally
at conferences.  Even easier is when someone else makes a discovery
and you are asked to comment on it.  You say, yes that person is
a serious researcher, and yes that discovery sure sounds important,
though of course much more work will be required before we are sure.
</p><p>

Or perhaps you want to start a sideline of popularizing work in your
field.  Unless you are a real popularization prodigy you wouldn't
want to make popularization into your major line of work, because
that is an entirely different and exceedingly competitive profession
that requires extreme amounts of networking in entirely different
worlds from your own.  But writing popular works as a sideline can
be lucrative, personally satisfying, and a public service, if not
necessarily in that order.  Stephen Jay Gould's monthly magazine
columns about biology, which have been collected into a long series
of successful books, are perhaps the prototype. </p><p>

If you want to write these sorts of popular works, you face several
sorts of challenges.  One is that all of your academic colleagues
believe that it's their job to help you get tenure, and so they
will all discourage you from writing such works until that happens.
I know of one department, an extreme case I'll admit, that actually
put in writing a policy that non-academic publications will be counted
against a candidate for tenure.  But if you write easily, I personally
see no problem of spending a day a month, as Gould did, writing that
sort of thing, and if you publish enough refereed journal articles
then only the crazies will hold it against you. </p><p>

A second challenge is that wide-circulation newspapers and magazines
prefer to publish work by people they know.  The solution to this
problem is actually easy: start an Internet mailing list and Web
site to circulate your popular work.  Your circulation will be low
at first, but your work probably won't be very good at first either,
so that's okay.  As your work gets better, people will pass it around
and your circulation will go up.  If your work is good then it will
definitely get circulated to the editors who should be publishing it.
Part of their job is to look for new talent. </p><p>

A final challenge for the popularizer is simply coming up with a
steady stream of topics to write about.  You can probably come up
with a few topics just from your own research, but if you want to
write regularly then you will need to cultivate the right sort of
intellectual life.  Popularization is really for people whose reading
and thinking are not confined strictly to the latest research reports
by their micro-specialized peers, but who naturally spend a reasonable
percentage of their reading and thinking time ranging more widely
into the deeper meanings of the field.  If this kind of breadth comes
naturally to you, or if you take the trouble to cultivate it, then
it's particularly important that a wider audience get the benefit of
your effort.  The writing will come hard at first.  But as you start
writing regularly, something good will happen: you will find yourself
spontaneously rehearsing phrases that relate the ideas to the world of
a normal reader, and before long you will establish a kind of pipeline
back and forth between the professional world where you present your
research papers and the public world where normal curious people are
concerned about the things that normal curious people are concerned
about.  Columns will take form almost spontaneously in your head, and
you will write them down.  So don't be disheartened by the difficulty
of getting the process started.  It will get easier. </p><p>

What's really hard is when you are called upon to address yourself to
different issues than the ones that organize discussion in your field.
Any sphere of debate, whether scholarly or political or anything else,
has an "issue agenda" (also called its "problem set"): the questions
that are consensually considered to be on the table right now, and
that everyone is expected to address themselves to.  The people in
your field probably have a consensus about which issues are important
right now, and you have probably learned how to talk in a way that
addresses those issues.  Problems arise when the broader public,
or more accurately the pundits and politicians in the media, have
a different issue agenda.  A reporter will call you on the phone,
perhaps having gotten your name from your university's PR office
as an expert in a certain field, and will expect you to address the
issue that happens to define public discourse.  You will find to your
surprise that you aren't able to speak to that issue, for the simple
reason that your day-to-day professional life has rarely required
you to do so.  You might select from your repertoire whatever standard
spiel falls in the general vicinity of the reporter's question, only
to be told, politely or not, that you're heading off at some weird
academic angle to (what the reporter regards as) the real issue. </p><p>

The solution to this problem is, first, to understand it, and second,
practice.  You simply have to figure out what the issue agenda is and
come up with something to say.  As a voice in the public sphere, you
will be expected to have a "message": a single line that responds in
some way to the issue agenda and that epitomizes the larger collection
of things that you have to say.  (My own "message", in case you happen
to care, is that radically improved information technology is causing
the ground rules of every institution in society to be renegotiated.)
You should also be prepared to answer some standard questions, most
particularly what implications your argument has for public policy.
This would seem like an obvious question, since that's what the
sphere of public debate is all about.  But unless your research area
is directly related to public policy, your professional training has
taught you how to address research agendas, not public policy agendas. 
So give the question some thought and rehearse some answers before you
get caught flat-footed. </p><p>

It helps if you understand how the public sphere works in practice.
Political philosophers often have an idealized picture of the public
sphere in which citizens get together and engage in deliberation, or
in which public intellectuals spin an elite sort of public philosophy. 
This idealized picture is almost entirely false.  In reality, the
public sphere is itself a sprawling professional network with its own
meetings, gossip, rivalries, and the rest of it.  At the center are
journalists, by which I mean not just day-to-day working reporters but
a broader class of professional writers who make their careers largely
by building extensive networks within the field they report on.
Many of these figures go on to become semi-intellectuals in their own
right, for example by publishing serious books or starting institutes.
Also at the center are foundations, many of which specifically intend
to shape public debate by building networks and publishing reports
that are designed for maximum coverage in the media.  Some foundations
regard themselves as nonpartisan, and spend their money flying people
to resorts to debate the issues of the day.  Others are aggressively
lean and mean think tanks that exist to argue the positions of their
funders.  If any money is at stake then the players will also include
lobbyists and other professional advocates. </p><p>

Scholarly researchers such as yourself are definitely part of this
picture, and do get invited to the talking shops where the real work
gets done.  As you establish a public voice in your area, you may
get swept into this world.  You will develop a network outside your
research field, and you will have to decide how much time and effort
you want to invest cultivating it and pushing your own public agenda
through it.  Understand that this is not the research community
whose rules I have been explaining.  Even though most of the people
are decent and serious, it is a different world that runs on its own
rails.  They don't use formal peer review, methodology is often weak,
sophistry is widespread, sound bites are important, and the essence
of the game is shaping the evolving issue agenda.  Because everyone
is assumed to have a public persona, you won't be sending people your
publications unless someone asks for them.  On another level, though,
the similarities to the research world are strong: you succeed by
building networks, the glue that holds relationships together is the
values that you share with people, and the way you get things done is
by articulating emerging issues within the collective thinking of that
particular network. </p><p>

Last comment.  Although normal rules of etiquette will largely suffice
for your dealings with the world of public debate, it will help to
keep in mind that people in the non-profit sector (meaning, outside
of universities and corporations) who are funded by foundations have
a very fragile existence.  If networking is important for your career,
it is ten times more important for these people.  The way they feed
their families is by defining an issue, building consensus with the
relevant foundation people, and finally being invited to write a short
grant proposal that gets them the money.  This is a long-drawn-out
process, and it requires continual upkeep.  When you are dealing with
such people, therefore, you should take special care not to be seen
as encroaching on their issue-territory.  Being an academic, you may
not feel like you are competing with them.  But they don't know that.
So even a stray comment about how you're interested in a certain
topic, or wrote a comment on a certain subject, can be misinterpreted
as announcing an attack on their foundation funding.  Your life is
easier than theirs. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="final"> A final point </a> </strong> </p><p>

Before you get too comfortable with the relatively advanced skills
I have described in this section, I hope you will take a moment
and remember what it was like not having a clue about professional
networking.  Fix this memory firmly into your mind, and bring it back
any time you're working around junior people.  Cut them some slack,
explain to them what's going on, and hand them a copy of "Networking
on the Network". </p><p>

&nbsp; </p><p>

</p><h3> <strong> <a name="section4">SECTION 4.  Networking and Your
Dissertation</a> </strong> </h3> <p>

What is the role of your dissertation in all this?  After all, many
people are mystified that graduate schools expect their students to
spend years preparing an enormous document that will get stuck on a
library shelf where maybe five people will ever read it.  (Speaking
of which, you should be one of the five: go to the library and look
at the structure and language of some dissertations, just so your goal
will be concrete in your mind.)  I do realize that many people go on
to chop their dissertations into journal articles or revise them into
books, and in some fields one prepares a dissertation by publishing
several articles and then binding them together.  I have no problem
with any of that.  Nonetheless, a narrow focus on publication misses
most of the point of writing a dissertation. </p><p>

Here is the profound fact: when you produce a dissertation, the most
important thing you produce is yourself -- that is, yourself as a
new member of the research profession generally, and of a particular
research community.  Becoming a new member of a research community is
not simply a matter of doing some research, nor is it simply a matter
of getting a publication accepted by a journal.  It's much deeper than
that: becoming a member of a research community means knitting yourself
into a web of relationships and dialogues.  Remember all of that
work you did in the library to identify people whose research was
related to yours?  Those people are going to become your professional
colleagues.  You are accountable to them: you have to give them credit
for their work, and the institutions of research will turn to them
when it's time to evaluate your work.  You are going to be engaged
in a conversation with them: the papers you write will be, among other
things, responses to what the people before you have written.  As you
read those people's work, and then later as you converse with them,
their voices will take up residence in your head, and your voice will
take up residence in their heads. </p><p>

Establishing this very complex set of relationships to this enormous
cast of characters is not easy.  It takes time and practice.  And
that is what your dissertation is for.  Your dissertation should of
course report important original research.  But just as importantly,
it should represent in great depth how that research is related to
all of the relevant research that other people have done.  It will
represent those relationships in obvious ways through your citations
and reviews of related literature.  But it will represent them in a
hundred more subtle ways as well.  Certain words will have acquired
specialized meanings and connotations, for example through their
association with particular authors and their views, and by using
those words in certain ways you will define yourself in relation
to others who have used them (or not used them).  People whose
intellectual background and assumptions differ from yours will
probably misinterpret many passages from your first draft, and one
purpose of getting comments and making revisions is to anticipate
those misinterpretations and search for language that will convey
your meaning to all the diverse sorts of people who will hopefully
be reading it.  In the course of making yourself intelligible to
those people, you will be constructing a relationship to them. </p><p>

In short, you are rehearsing a professional voice.  This is hard
work, and many people who are developing a new professional voice will
feel that they are being torn apart by the huge variety of seemingly
incompatible demands that come from every side.  After all, you will
be joining a research community in which people disagree with each
other, in which people have read things that you couldn't possibly
have time to read, in which everybody holds assumptions that they have
not articulated fully, and in which some people are hard to get along
with.  And yet you are supposed to talk in some way that takes this
whole buzzing confusion into account while simultaneously expressing
what <i>you</i> want to say, in the way that <i>you</i> want to say
it.  It can be done, because innumerable people have done it.  It
takes time, though, and iterations and revisions, and feedback from
professional colleagues.  Reading and rereading those colleagues'
written work is a good way to anticipate their thinking, but it does
not substitute for personal contact.  So make those contacts.  And
as you build your community, and as you take seriously the comments
you get on drafts, your voice will evolve.  You will no longer have
the sense of being pulled apart.  You will be able to identify the
emerging themes that knit your work into the community, and that
start to make the community seem unitary.  Your ability to articulate
those emerging themes is a sure sign that your project is part of
a community, and that your audience will understand what you are
talking about.  It means that you have established a deep underground
continuity between your own project and the projects of your
professional colleagues.  It also means that your project will be
noticed, and that it will not fall through the cracks.  This is the
goal.  Along the way to this goal, you will of course make a couple
of mistakes.  You will say some dumb things.  You will get a bit
of criticism.  But that's life.  When the bad stuff happens, make
mid-course corrections and carry on.  Everyone else has been there
too.
</p><p>

It helps if you understand the structural reasons why graduate school
can be so difficult.  In passing through graduate school and joining
the research community, you are making a transition from one social
identity to another, and from one professional persona to another.
In a sense you are becoming a new person.  But you face an irreducible
chicken-and-egg problem: you can't do research without being a member
of a research community, and you can't be a member of a research
community without doing research.  This chicken-and-egg problem
is typically at its worst in the middle phase of graduate school,
after you finish your required coursework but before you narrow down
a dissertation topic.  During that middle period, the whole world
can seem chaotic.  All of your candidate topics will seem impossibly
gigantic.  It might feel like you are pretending to do research rather
than really doing it.  People will keep asking you, "when is your
thesis going to be done?".  You might be seized by paranoia about
people who will persecute you publicly as soon as you try to present
your work.  These are common feelings; understand that they result
from the structural situation you are in, and not from your own
personal failings or (necessarily) the failings of other people around
you. </p><p>

Once you understand the structural chicken-and-egg problem, you can
set a strategy for overcoming it.  Start by looking for ways to watch
the professional world in action.  Ask your advisor for suggestions.
You might sit in on a program committee meeting, serve as a referee
for conference or journal papers, coauthor a survey paper, host
some visiting speakers, have coffee with a visiting fellow in your
department, or volunteer to help with the logistics of a conference.
These tasks require labor, of course, some of it mundane.  But they
will also help you become comfortable with the rhythms and styles of
your new professional community. </p><p>

More fundamentally, though, you will overcome your chicken-and-egg
problem through iteration: starting small and then working back and
forth between the chicken side (defining your topic, rehearsing your
voice) and the egg side (building your network, getting feedback).
That's why you should start building your network just as soon as
you have a conference paper to present, but no sooner.  You needn't
pursue a hundred network contacts on the basis of that first small
paper, and you probably shouldn't.  Contact a few especially promising
individuals, just to get some practice.  Then work up to more
ambitious public presentations of your work and more ambitious levels
of socializing.  If you follow this plan then your dissertation, once
it is finally done, will be your masterpiece: your proof to yourself
and others that you finally have a professional voice, and that you
are finally knitted into the professional network that you want to
join. </p><p>

Here is another way to understand it.  Many beginning scholars
experience a conflict between their own personal interests and the
demands that the institution places on them.  They feel that the
politics of their department or discipline prevent them from pursuing
the ideas that they care about, or that funding imperatives push
them toward boring research topics that are geared to someone else's
agenda, or even that the research world in general is cynical and
filled with self-interested poseurs.  I'm not here to tell you
that the research world is a thoroughly beautiful place.  It's a
human place, with all of the virtues and vices that come with that.
What you have to understand, and you have to trust me about this,
is that most of the bad feelings that I have described are simply
consequences of the structural process that you are passing through.
If you really do your homework, and if you really do your networking,
and if you really take the trouble to study and internalize the ideas
and voices of the researchers in your field whose work you respect,
and if you really get out there and become involved in the activities
of your profession, then eventually that inner sense of a conflict
between yourself and your environment will dissipate.  The great thing
about the research world is that you get to choose your environment,
which consists in large measure of the members of your network.  Of
course, this also means choosing the topics you work on, the language
you speak, the values you embrace, the dialogue you participate in,
and so on.  You choose the whole package.  You make it.  You build it.
</p><p>

And as you do so, you and your environment will become aligned.
Internalizing all of those other people's voices will change you.
The changes will happen almost automatically, and for the most part
you won't even realize that it's happening.  You may not even remember
the time when you felt that your research interests were incompatible
with the professional environment around you.  Of course, you will
not be completely free, the way you'd be if you had a million dollars.
You will still have to build networks, write grant proposals, and so
on.  But you will be woven into the institutional structures that make
all these things possible, so that doing them will be the most natural
thing in the world.  That is what your dissertation is for.  In fact,
your dissertation is, in a paradoxical way, a time of great freedom.
It is the moment when you choose <i>where</i> in the great sprawling
fabric of the research community you are going to knit yourself.  So
take the time to read widely, reflect deeply, talk to lots of people,
and choose the topic that will propel you into the life you want,
rather than the life that someone else might stand ready to choose for
you. </p><p>

This understanding of the dissertation suggests strategies for dealing
with several common problems that arise with dissertations.  I will
describe three of them, in the beginning, middle, and end of the
process. </p><p>

Beginning.  Graduate students who are writing thesis proposals
often try to bite off too much -- their proposals describe a life's
work, not a couple of years' worth.  Paring down the initial proposal
to a manageable size can often be a dispiriting process; it feels as
though you are surrendering your ambitions and ideals, step by step,
until you have compromised everything that was valuable about your
original vision.  I have seen this many times.  The underlying problem
is a misunderstanding of the way that research is evaluated.  People
will evaluate your research partly for what you have accomplished:
which theorem you've proved, which ancient city you've discovered,
which grammatical patterns you've explained, or whatever.  You do need
to accomplish something, of course.  But more fundamentally, people
will look at the methods by which you did it.  They will ask not only
"what did s/he do?" but "what direction does s/he point?".  If you
prove a big theorem by means of a tortured calculation that provides no
useful guidance for proving other theorems then you won't get a lot of
reward for it.  Your ideas and methods should generalize.  They should
map a previously unsuspected territory for research.  This matters in
job-hunting terms, since your prospective colleagues will want to know
whether you have a practicable research program laid out.  So when you
write your dissertation proposal, don't assign yourself an infinite
task.  Instead, ask yourself what fragment of that task would make
a relatively self-contained project, and would also provide a clear
illustration of the more general project that you see ahead of you.
Present your thesis study as an example, a case study, an illustration,
of the more general theme that you have identified, and take care
to draw out and explain the generality of that theme.  If you follow
this strategy then the dissertation itself might resemble a staircase:
it begins with the overall research direction that you are announcing,
and then it steps down into successively more specific applications
of that overall approach, laying out the theoretical concepts
and relevant literature at each step, until finally you present
the specific results that you've obtained.  Then, having presented
your results, you can work your way back to the top, step by step.
This is not the only possible architecture for your dissertation,
but at least it's one approach to managing the complexity. </p><p>

Middle.  In writing a dissertation, and especially when writing a
talk about the dissertation research, one often encounters points
that need to be stuck in the introduction or conclusion.  Terms need
to be defined, methodology needs to be explained, objections need to
be anticipated, patterns need to be identified, distinctions need to
be made, and unanswered questions need to be acknowledged and posed
as problems for future work.  Of course, everyone tries to assign
these points to a suitable place when preparing an outline.  But many
students find that the points just keep coming, as if a volcano were
continually erupting in the middle of the thesis, causing a disorderly
mass of troublesome junk to flow out toward the edges.  The sheer mass
of this junk can be overwhelming, and it can seem as though the whole
thesis is going to turn into a hypertrophied introduction and (to a
lesser extent) conclusion, with the actual substance of the work left
as an afterthought.  You should plan for this process, and realize
that it is crucial for the formation of your professional voice.
What's happening, believe it or not, is that your mind is reorganizing
itself.  You are integrating all of the many voices that will lay
claim to your topic, and you are sorting out a conceptual framework
for your research program that addresses all of those many voices
in a coherent way.  You may not think that you are engaging with
other people's voices, since the depths of thesis-writing are a very
personal, even isolating process.  But if you are at the point of
writing a thesis then you have already done a great deal of reading,
and so you are familiar with established patterns of thinking on many
subjects.  Those are the voices that you are integrating at this point
of the process. </p><p>

End.  Writing a dissertation is like living at the bottom of the
ocean: the project itself is so large, and the process of imposing
intellectual order on the project and on the thesis document itself
is so enormous, that you become accustomed to a kind of total immersion
that is unusual in other areas of life.  This is mostly a good thing,
or at least inevitable.  A dissertation is a big accomplishment, and
if you can finish your dissertation then everyone knows that you can
do research on your own.  Nonetheless, students often get into trouble
as they resurface from the bottom of the dissertation ocean -- a kind
of intellectual bends that can be painful and confusing if you don't
understand it.  When you are living down there amidst the infinite
details of your dissertation project, you can forget that everyone
else isn't living down there with you.  As a result, you can lose your
ability to explain your project to other people.  You will begin your
explanations at the fourth or fifth step of the argument, leaving out
all of the premises that explain what the project really is, why it
is important, what all the words mean, and how the whole thing fits
into something that your audience can relate to.  You may never have
learned to explain your project to anyone outside your research group,
and as a result you may find yourself confronted with basic questions
that you can't answer.  A well-run research group helps dissertation
authors to return to the surface of the ocean in a controlled way by
offering them constructive advice about the sorts of questions they
will get in the outside world.  But even the best research group
cannot predict these questions in the necessary detail.  This is one
more reason why it is important to keep building your network, even as
you deal with the pressure of writing and deadlines. </p><p>

During the final days of your dissertation project, you may run into
another distressing circumstance: you will be reading someone else's
work, and you will suddenly develop a powerful sense that this other
person has already done your project.  When this happens, realize that
you are probably suffering from a thesis-induced delusion.  Except in
the hardest of subjects like mathematics, it is rare for someone else
literally to have done the same project as yours, or even a project
that makes your own obsolete.  It happens, yes, but it's probably not
happening to you.  What's actually happening is much more interesting:
because of your total immersion in the logic of your research, you
are engaging with the other person's work in greater depth than you
are probably used to.  As a result, you are tuning into their thinking
at a deeper level than is normally possible.  This feeling can be
scary and intimidating, but roll with it.  As you first get your mind
around what the person is saying, you can feel as though your entire
worldview is being transformed.  You may then go through a phase
in which it seems like your whole dissertation needs to be rewritten.
This is probably a delusion as well.  Go ahead and allow the other
person's work to be a corrective to various mistakes and thin spots
in your own thinking.  If you're really getting lost then get advice.
Eventually the storms will die down and you can identify the specific
revisions and extensions that will be required to give fair credit to
the other person, as well as improving your own work.  You may even go
through a few cycles of this.  It's normal. </p><p>

My conception of your dissertation as an occasion for professional
network-knitting may sound different from other people's.  But I think
that my conception is the right one.  A much more common approach is
to keep your head down, staying in the lab and the library until your
dissertation is done, and only then making contacts with others in
your field.  In my opinion this is a terrible strategy.  It works only
if your dissertation advisor is doing all of your networking for you,
and only if your dissertation advisor is capable of anticipating and
telling you about all of the reactions that everyone in the relevant
world is going to have to your work.  Making yourself dependent
on your advisor in that way might actually suffice, but it is not
something to count on.  Unless you have already joined the research
community, which you haven't, you cannot yet be certain that your
advisor is sufficiently talented at networking and communicating.
By all means develop a good relationship with your advisor, but
use that relationship to help you build your own community.  If you
don't have a community then you can't be confident that anybody will
understand your work, or that anybody will care about it.  And without
that confidence, you will probably not be able to get a job. </p><p>

</p><h3> <strong> <a name="section5">SECTION 5.  Academic Language</a>
</strong> </h3> <p>

As a new graduate student, you face a whole series of institutional
problems that are hard to explain to someone who hasn't already
mastered the workings of the institution.  One problem is endemic
to human life in general, namely that you're always entering
conversations in the middle.  You show up someplace -- a new job,
perhaps -- and the people there already have a conversation going on.
They probably have quite a few running conversations, and they have
probably accumulated a big network of shared background assumptions.
Many words have probably acquired specialized local meanings whether
the people are aware of it or not.  Meanings will have been shaped
by long-past events (what anthropologists call "critical incidents")
and by political fault-lines that nobody ever needs to mention.
Even an innocent word choice can place you on one side of a conflict
or another.  These phenomena need not be spectacular or pathological,
but they are certainly universal, and they can seriously confuse a
newcomer. </p><p>

One way to understand academic language is that this
entering-a-conversation-in-the-middle effect is amplified about twenty
times relative to any normal setting.  That's because academics are
paid to say things that are new, which is very hard, so that they are
continually torquing their language -- usually for good reasons, but
of course not always.  As a result, you can be forgiven if you feel
like you are walking around in a linguistic minefield.  What is worse,
the language that you will encounter in academic settings is a kind
of capital.  That is, the ability to use the language is a valuable
commodity.  Talking a specialized academic language is what one gets
paid to do, or at least it's a precondition of what one gets paid to
do, which is hopefully to say something, and so it is understandable
if you feel obligated to learn the languages you hear. </p><p>

As a teacher, I find these things frustrating.  I encounter students
who feel compelled to learn the latest fashionable jargon whether it
serves them or not.  Usually I demur.  My first question is always:
what do you care about?  Once we answer that basic question, we can
go looking for suitable conversations to join.  But graduate students
are not stupid, to the contrary, and if Foucauldian vocabulary
is valuable capital then they can spot that fact a mile away.
They are intimidated by the job market, and they intend to get the
capital they will need to get a job.  I don't mean to overgeneralize.
Everyone is different.  Still, I often find myself saying, no, you
really don't have to learn to talk that way unless you intend to join
a conversation in which everyone else talks that way.  But that's not
how it seems when you're new and you have to graduate in five years
and you don't yet have a differentiated sense of the terrain.  Who's
really right? </p><p>

As an example of the train-wrecks that these phenomena can cause, let
us consider the famous problem of importing French philosophy to the
United States.  The French think highly of philosophy, and they have
an exceedingly centralized and hierarchical meritocratic system for
identifying and training the best philosophical talent.  Even though
they take their philosophical training system for granted and even
harp on its defects, it nonetheless works very well.  True, most
of the really famous French philosophers are consigned to the margins
of the system.  (See Pierre Bourdieu's entertaining preface to the
English edition of his <i>Homo Academicus</i>.)  But they exist,
which is more than we can say for the other systems.  What this means
is that French philosophers assume an audience that is widely read
and deeply sophisticated, and that will know and recognize all of the
precursors of their ideas. </p><p>

This system may sound bad to American ears, but it works: it enables
these authors to get a great deal of intellectual leverage from the
background of knowledge that they share with their readers.  It is
the kind of pressure-cooker that, as Randall Collins suggests in his
stupendous book <i>The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of
Intellectual Change</i> (Harvard University Press, 1998), is required
for any great philosophy to get done.  It is the ongoing-conversation
effect multiplied by fifty instead of twenty, and its decline is
probably why (with the possible exception of Michel Serres) no great
philosophy is being written right now.  To get an idea of what I
mean, have a look at Mark C. Taylor, ed, <i>Deconstruction in Context:
Literature and Philosophy</i> (University of Chicago Press, 1986).
It is a scholarly sourcebook of the precursors of Derrida's method of
deconstruction, and it is a revelation.  Derrida suddenly seems not
like something from another planet but like an incremental advance
beyond a whole series of people like Levinas, Bataille, and Blanchot.
Now, serious specialized scholars in the United States certainly
understand this.  But it takes real work to become that serious, and
most people, not having been brought up in the French system, will
never have the time. </p><p>

Now pick up some French philosophical texts and move them to another
country, such as the United States.  It is a notorious fact that some
American scholars have copied the style of a Foucault in a superficial
way, and now we're in a position to understand why this causes so much
trouble.  Academic discourse only works if it's part of a dialogue.
In France, philosophical dialogue works because everyone knows the
background.  Individual authors can develop highly personal writing
styles without disrupting the conversation.  Everyone has read
Leibniz, and so everyone can allude to him constantly without naming
him.  Some of those writing styles have more of a point than others,
and I've chosen Foucault as my example because his own style (prior
to the relatively plain language of his last few books) was much less
motivated than that of the others.  When Americans copy these styles,
disaster often results because the conversation is broken.  Readers
in the American context generally cannot see the language as part of a
densely organized dialogue, so the whole thing locks up.  The dialogue
loses its dynamic, forward-moving quality, and everyone falls into
a kind of intellectual autism, a black hole from which nothing can
emerge. </p><p>

This is not to say that Foucault, for example, has had no beneficial
impact on American scholarship.  Scholars who employ the ideas
without copying the style often have useful things to say.  An example
would be John and Jean Comaroff's multiple-volume anthropological
history of the Tswana in northern South Africa, <i>Of Revelation and
Revolution</i> (University of Chicago Press, 1991 and 1997).  Their
research is influenced by Foucault, but you wouldn't know it to read
their prose, which is somewhat mannered to be sure but for their own
reasons and not because they are copying anybody.  Instead of falling
into a solipsistic vortex of writing style, they have engaged with the
ideas and digested them into their own thinking, along with everything
else that they have engaged with, which is a lot. </p><p>

There is one final reason why people in academia, including graduate
students, often feel compelled to acquire specialized languages that
are not necessarily suited to their own projects: academic languages
exhibit network effects.  Just as people around the world invest in
learning and speaking English because so many other people already
speak English, likewise the theoretical vocabulary of a particular
author can become the de facto standard of conversation in a
certain field.  And in case you think this is just an artefact of
the fashion-ridden humanities, you should know that mathematics is
one of the fields where it happens most furiously.  A mathematician
who invents a new formalism (what they call "machinery") will be
forgotten unless other mathematicians use that formalism to prove
theorems of their own.  Often a variety of formalisms are available
that do generally the same kind of work.  Each mathematician has
an incentive (not necessarily overriding, especially when the choice
of machinery makes a major difference in the results one can obtain,
but still significant) to use the same machinery that everyone else
is using, precisely for purposes of compatibility.  In this way the
development of mathematics is path-dependent, with some well-promoted
or centrally-networked authors defining the basis of subsequent
development in their fields while other authors retire in obscurity.
I don't mean to disparage the mathematicians' culture, which is
perfectly nice.  It's not about anyone's human qualities.  Network
effects happen whether people are elbowing one another or not. </p><p>

The same thing is true in many other fields.  Once Foucault becomes
the vocabulary of choice for talking about the social construction of
the body, for example, people will use Foucault-speak for that purpose
even though some other author's vocabulary might be better-suited to
a particular purpose.  And just as newcomers to a field of mathematics
frequently sledgehammer a problem with machinery that is too general
to reveal the problem's inner logic, likewise newcomers to social
theory will use five-star Foucauldian jargon to say things that could
be said using the admirably plain language of John Commons or Anselm
Strauss.  Outsiders will mistake this for academic empty-headedness,
and that's sometimes what it is.  But at least as often it's
more complicated.  And the humanities and social sciences get a
disproportionately bad reputation for doing it because outsiders
haven't the slightest clue what the mathematicians are saying, whereas
they think they have a clue what the others are saying. </p><p>

So that's what happens.  As a graduate student, you are walking into
the middle of a complicated set of dynamics that nobody ever explains.
It's little wonder, then, if you feel compelled to master arbitrary
codes that your career seems to depend on.  It's that structural
situation that I am interested in, not the properties of graduate
students themselves. </p><p>

Because you are not yet in a position to see the inner logic of your
professional community, you may find yourself wanting to fasten onto
formal aspects of the process: politicking your thesis committee,
passing exams, mastering jargons, and so on.  You can't ignore that
stuff, but you can get it into proportion by focusing your attention
on the communities you want to join.  Needlessly esoteric academic
languages can give you the wrong idea: they portray research as a
matter of becoming someone else, rather than becoming a professional
version of yourself.  They make it seem like becoming a researcher
means acquiring someone else's voice, rather than developing your own.
And they exaggerate the degree to which success in research depends
on making yourself accountable to other people's agendas, rather than
actively seeking out a community of interlocutors whose agendas can be
brought into productive dialogue with your own. </p><p>

The institutions of research are hardly perfect.  But I think that
their imperfections would be best alleviated not by blowing them
up and placing them under the power of some extraneous authority,
but rather by systematically teaching graduate students the things
that I am saying here.  Owning and applying a powerful model of the
institutional dynamics around you is where sanity begins, and it is
the best way to dissuade people from the misguided strategies that
reproduce institutional pathologies rather than dissolving them. </p><p>

</p><h3> <strong> <a name="section6">SECTION 6.  How to Get a Job</a>
</strong> </h3> <p>

<strong> <a name="job-hunting"> Networks and job-hunting </a>
</strong> </p><p>

The world is full of books about getting a job, and most of them are
preoccupied with the formal aspects of the process: learning about job
openings, filling out the paperwork, giving a job talk, and that sort
of thing.  Those formal aspects are important, but you will completely
misunderstand them unless you understand the substance: relationships
and community-building.  Get used to a deep intuition: the right
way to get a job is to build a network.  Once you build a network,
formal things like jobs just happen.  A network is not only a list
of people you happen to know, like points that you score in a video
game.  A network is a circuit through which things flow: ideas, energy,
dialogue, information, favors, and so on.  Being in dialogue with
the people in your network means that you have identified values that
you share with them, so that you say "we" and "us".  You have chosen
the members of your network precisely <i>because</i> of the values
that you share in common, and you have taken the trouble to identify
those shared values and to get a running conversation started that is
founded on them.  And in the process you have changed: you have drawn
out and articulated parts of yourself that may not have had any words
before.  It's still you, but it's a version of you that is defined
in part by its relationships to other people.  If you have chosen
those other people badly then you will be unhappy with your new self.
But if you have done your homework and chosen wisely then you will be
thrilled to death. </p><p>

And this is where jobs come from.  Among the good things that flow in
professional networks are things related to jobs: the official public
information about job openings, the inside scoop about job openings,
the informal invitations that enable you to meet people before you
have to deal with the formalities of job openings, the postdoctoral
fellowships that keep you going until you identify the job openings
you really want, and so on.  If you have really built your network,
then it will seem like the most natural thing in the world for this
good stuff to flow into your mailbox every day.  It takes time and
effort to build a network, but this is the payoff.  Having a member
of your network on the hiring committee makes a big difference.  The
effort that you've invested in articulating shared values will help
that person to articulate to the rest of the committee what the job
should be about.  The effort that you've invested in communicating
your work will help that person to explain you to everyone else.  The
effort that you've invested in commencing a dialogue with that person
will be the first installment on your effort in commencing a dialogue
with everyone else in the department.  But don't think of it as,
"if I get to know this person then maybe I will get this job".  That's
fake and it doesn't work.  Get to know people because you respect
them -- because you have some shared interests and values that you
want to develop.  Then just believe that good things will flow from
that, someday, somehow. </p><p>

Many people refuse to believe all of this.  They look at me like I am
stupid and they say, "but the job market sucks" or "but it all comes
down to power" or "but I'm marginalized because I'm this or that".
People who believe such things are setting themselves up to fail;
they are rehearsing their excuse.  Yes, the job market is real; yes,
power is real; yes, discrimination is real.  But if you believe that
those gigantic abstractions are the fundamental and immutable reality
of the world, then you will make that belief true in your own life.
In encouraging you to work from a more positive set of beliefs, I
am not saying that your failure to get a job, if that's what ends up
happening, is your own fault.  But I <i>am</i> saying that your lack
of a job <i>is</i> your fault if it's something that you chose, and if
you go around saying, "such-and-such gigantic abstraction means that
I'll never be able to get a job", then you are choosing not to get
a job.  Here is the truth: no matter how bad the job market is, no
matter how bad the power deal is, no matter how much discrimination
there is, the thing to do about the problem is to follow my advice
and build yourself a professional network.  Lots of people out there
share your values, including people whose lives and backgrounds are
otherwise completely different from yours.  You need to find those
people and establish relationships with them. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="announcements"> Job announcements </a> </strong> </p><p>

Now that I've gotten my lectures out of the way, how do you get a
job?  Let's assume that you have been building your network, and that
you have been presenting papers at conferences, and that you have
been making your work available on the Web, and that you have engaged
in other activities that make you and your work visible in your field.
Let's assume, in other words, that you have done the first 90% of the
work.  The last 10% of the work is the formal part, and it starts with
the job advertisement.  Given that you know so many people and hear
so much useful information by e-mail, you probably know about most
of the jobs before they are advertised.  But you won't know about all
of them, so join professional societies and study their job-posting
bulletin boards, which might be published in the society's
newsletter.  Or look in a publication such as the <i>Chronicle
of Higher Education</i> that publishes large numbers of job ads.
(The <i>Chronicle</i> works as a business matter because affirmative
action laws require universities to publicize jobs widely.  This is
good.)  It is a good idea to study these ads a year before you go on
the market, just to get a sense of them. </p><p>

When you do read the ads, you will find that most of them are written
in Martian: the people seem to want someone whose skills come from a
completely different disciplinary background from yours.  This is not
a cause for panic.  One reason to build a professional network is that
you will learn to speak different languages.  When speaking with a
person who speaks Martian, try to explain yourself in Martian as well
as you honestly can.  Of course you won't really be speaking fluent
Martian, but you'll be meeting your interlocutor halfway.  (The secret
to speaking Martian, by the way, is not to use a lot of Martian words
that you don't identify with.  Instead, articulate in plain language,
on an intuitive, everyday level, the key insights of the Martian
worldview, and then frame your ideas in relation to that.  You'll be
speaking Martian without the jargon, and the Martians will like it.)
Having thus built a network that includes people whose language is
different from yours, you will be less shocked when it's finally time
to go on the job market.  You'll have come up with ways to explain
yourself and your work in Martian, and you will know how to apply
for a job ad on Mars.  Of course, you will have to decide whether you
<i>want</i> to work on Mars, but the time to decide that is after you
have a sheaf of job offers in your hand. </p><p>

Which jobs should you apply for?  All of them.  Having impossibly many
interviews or offers is an easy problem to solve.  Your real choice
is how much effort to put into applying for each of the available
jobs.  It is possible to expend a huge effort applying for a job, and
so you need a sense of priorities.  If you have built a network then
it should be easy to figure out what your priorities are.  Most likely
the jobs you most want will be in the departments where you already
know people.  Find out about those jobs far enough in advance that
you can buy your friend a social beverage, say the magic words, "can
I ask your advice?", and ask about the real deal with the job.  Should
I apply?  How do the politics work?  Is there a strong consensus about
the definition of the job, or are there factions, or is it genuinely
open?  Which members of the department will I most need to connect
with?  What else should I know?  What should I emphasize in writing
the cover letter on my applications?  Are you on the search committee?
Who else is on it?  Don't bother asking your friend about internal
candidates for the job, however, since you can't do anything about
them and you'll just waste time with obsession and gossip.  Remember
that your friend just has one point of view.  Your friend might be
misinformed or preoccupied with some minor grievance, or may simply
not be perceptive.  Ultimately you have to use your judgement about
what to believe. </p><p>

You can learn more details about the available jobs in other ways.
Your friends and thesis committee members have their own networks,
and can pass along reputations and other useful information.  You
should certainly look at the department's Web site.  Get a list of the
faculty, figure out which ones are closest intellectually to yourself,
and hit the library.  Individual faculty may have their own home
pages, but online materials are less important than published books
and articles. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="applying"> Applying </a> </strong> </p><p>

Now it is time to apply.  I will explain how to apply for a faculty
position at a research university because that is what I know, but I
expect that the broad outlines of my explanation will apply elsewhere.
Some positions require application forms, but most job ads will simply
specify what you should send: a cover letter, a vita, publications,
recommendations, and that sort of thing.  If the ad specifies a
deadline, you should certainly try to make the deadline.  But even
if the deadline has gone by, apply anyway or at least ask whether
applications are still being accepted.  They want the best candidate
they can get, so they will probably not insist on formalities. </p><p>

The most important part of your application is your cover letter.
If nobody has explained the purpose of the cover letter, by all means
ask.  The customs vary, so I cannot give detailed instructions.  The
general idea, however, is that you write a formal letter, two or three
pages, to the chair of the department's search committee.  (If the
job ad does not provide this person's name, call the department office
and ask for it.)  Start by saying that you are writing to apply for
the job that was advertised in such-and-such a venue.  State precisely
what job you're applying for (e.g., "the assistant professor position
in bovine orthodontia in the Department of Veterinary Dentistry at the
University of the Witwatersrand", being careful to spell everything
correctly and extra careful that you don't mistakenly mention the name
of another school that you happen to be applying to).  If you have
discussed the job with any members of the department, say so.  If the
job ad specifies formal requirements for the job (e.g., having a PhD),
then be certain to state that you satisfy the requirements (assuming
that you do).  Then tell your story.  Expect to throw this letter
out and rewrite it at least three or four times.  Really.  Don't get
lazy and just send out the first draft because it seems good enough.
Assume that your first couple of drafts stink and need fundamental
rethinking.  Get feedback from your committee members and close
professional friends. </p><p>

Your goal in this letter, as in the entire process, is to articulate
a clear case for the fit between yourself and the department where you
are applying.  The raw materials for this story are the research that
you have done, the larger-scale research agenda that your dissertation
was part of, the kind of job you are looking for, the attributes
of the department that make it a good place for you to pursue your
research agenda, your teaching experience and specific details of
your commitment to teaching, and the particular individuals in the
department whose work is related to your own.  It needs to be the
best honest version of your story; don't spin or exaggerate anything,
because it's wrong and you'll get caught.  When applying to your
top five choices, strategize each letter pretty much from scratch;
then draw on the best pieces of those letters as you prepare a
more generic letter that you can vary slightly for the other places.
When applying to research-oriented universities, emphasize research
but also discuss teaching; when applying to teaching-oriented schools,
emphasize both and then expand on the real-world challenges and
opportunities that graduating students in your field will face --
and how your specific background and skills make you the right choice
for a department that wants to take the lead in this new environment.
Emphasize the future as well as the past.  Your letter must be
extremely well-written.  The prose should be clear and vigorous
without being bombastic or arrogant, calm and polite without being
obsequious or weak.  Get rid of commonplaces, cliches, empty formulas,
shallow fashion-following, fake boasting, and emotional manipulation.
Moderate the jargon.  Get to the point.  Get a good writer to copyedit
it for you.  Format it in a professional-looking way.  And print
the final version on good paper.  Your letter should be your best
representation of yourself and your plans for your career. </p><p>

Many people find this letter difficult because they are caught up in
a mental state of being desperate for a job.  "I'll take anything!",
they are thinking, and so they feel driven to write a letter that
conforms to (their fantasies about) what the people want, rather
than a letter that genuinely tries to articulate the two-way fit
between themselves and the department that they are applying to.
For example, if the job ad specifies that the applicant should be
able to teach topic X, these desperate people might tell some twisted
story about how they can teach X, even when it's not true.  This is
not a good idea.  Of course you are not going to present a unilateral,
take-it-or-leave-it kind of deal to the people.  Rather, you are going
to draw on your experience of talking to different people in your
network.  All this time you have been coming up with lots of different
honest ways of explaining yourself, and in your cover letter you
should explain yourself in the honest way that is the closest fit to
the people who are reading your letter.  Maybe it will not feel like a
precise fit, but it's better to be honest and confident and persuasive
than to make something up.  If you really believe what you are saying,
then that will come through in your letter.  You don't know whether
the specifications in the job ad are set in stone.  For all you know,
they wrote that ad without thinking very hard about it, and in fact
the job is still basically undefined.  When you come along, sounding
much more interesting and up-to-date than their boring ad, they will
want you rather than the hundred clones who conformed to the boring
expectations they had set up.  This is the truth: if there's no honest
story about you that fits precisely with the specifications in the
ad, then your best strategy is to tell the honest story about yourself
that fits best, even if it doesn't fit perfectly, and then let it go.
If it's going to happen then it will happen. </p><p>

In applying for a job, you may find yourself preparing a vita for the
first time.  A vita is the research world's equivalent of a resume.
It starts with your name and contact information, and then it details
your educational history, publications, teaching experience, and
other professional involvements.  A vita differs from a resume in an
important way: whereas resumes in the corporate world are filled with
puffed-up language that hypes the individual's past job experience,
a vita is more like a database entry -- just the facts.  You are going
to explain your background and future plans in your letter, not in
your vita.  The format of a vita is not especially standardized, but
you can look at your thesis advisor's vita and model yours on that.
In any event, make it neat and professional.  And do not include
items that aren't related to your professional persona, for example
information on your personal life (e.g., family or hobbies), personal
references (as opposed to researchers who can write about your
professional work), seminar or class papers (as opposed to conference
and journal papers), or technical reports in which you are not primary
or second author. </p><p>

Applications for research and teaching jobs also require letters
of recommendation from established researchers who know your work.
Practices differ; in most cases your recommenders will send their
letters direct to the department that you're applying to, but some
schools want you to arrange for letters at the time you apply, where
others prefer to be given recommenders' names so they can solicit
letters only from candidates who they are considering seriously.
If the job ad does not explain what they want, go ahead and ask
your recommenders to send the letters.  Asking someone to write a
letter for you is a serious matter.  The ideal letter-writer has two
properties: (a) knows you and your work (and in a positive way), and
(b) is known to the people who will be reading the letter (and in a
positive way).  If your field is relatively fragmented, or if you have
not been doing your networking, then those two properties might trade
off.  Most departments will want roughly four recommendation letters
for an entry-level job.  (For high-level full-professor jobs, as many
as twelve letters might be required.)  Line up your letter-writers a
few months before you send in your job applications. </p><p>

When it does come time for your letter-writers to write their letters,
you should try to make their lives easier.  First of all, you should
tell them precisely whom they should send the letter to (as with your
application letter, this should ideally be the chair of the search
committee), and the deadline, and the complete address.  (This seems
obvious, but when the time comes you will have a million things to do.
I'm telling you so you don't get sloppy.)  Also make sure that they
have an up-to-date stack of your papers (including the ones you wrote
for their courses), chapters from your thesis, your vita, and other
raw material.  I also recommend that you offer them a set of bullet
points that they can draw on -- for example, a concise statement
of the intellectual accomplishments of your thesis, the topic of
the research that you're planning post-thesis, your teaching history,
and the activities that illustrate your potential for intellectual
leadership.  Don't try to evaluate your work; just provide them with
the factual basis that they'll need to supply their own evaluations.
If they don't want the bullets then don't push it. </p><p>

Practices for writing the letters themselves are fairly personal and
vary a great deal.  Don't worry about what the letters contain; you
will probably never see them (at least those are the rules), and you
probably can't do anything about them anyway.  But to provide some
kind of intuition, let me explain how I write such letters myself
-- it's the method that I learned from the guy who supervised my
master's thesis.  First of all, I definitely ask for a set of bullets
from students, and I am struck that I must often ask two or three
times until I get the bullets I need.  Many students, even very good
ones, haven't rehearsed their voices enough to be able to explain
their own intellectual accomplishments.  This is not good.  Once I
do get the necessary bullets, I come up with everything positive that
I can honestly say about the person.  This is where the bullet points
come in: I use them to provide evidence for my positive statements,
and I use them to help me think of more positive things to say.  This
method makes letter-writing more convenient from a moral perspective,
since I don't have to struggle with my conscience about providing
negative evaluations.  I try to organize each letter around a single
headline -- the most important of the candidate's positive attributes
-- while trying to make sure that I cover everything positive that I
can come up with.  If a student has weaknesses, I simply don't mention
them, figuring that a letter that makes no mention of the student's
ideas, hard work, personality, or whatever will speak as loudly as
one that says bad things on those topics.  The people who read the
letters, all of whom write such letters all the time, will see what
I am doing, and they will interpret accordingly. </p><p>

I will admit that some people have more sophisticated approaches
to letters than I do; they have reverse-engineered the bureaucratic
processes in their heads, and they design their letters based on a
finely-detailed understanding of the bureaucratic process, including
the precise questions that the people who read the letter are going
to be asking themselves.  (I explain this further in Section 8.)
I don't have that kind of savoir-faire. </p><p>

Once you do apply for a job, you may also find that your network
contacts will volunteer to put in an informal good word for you.
This usually means that they will send a simple e-mail message
to their friend in the department where you're applying, saying
"this person is smart and I think would make a good match for your
department".  There is nothing wrong with offering to send these
back-channel messages, and you should normally accept.  The main
exception is if you do not trust either the sincerity or the judgement
of the person doing the offering. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="interviews"> Interviews </a> </strong> </p><p>

Next you will be invited to job interviews.  If you apply for lots
of jobs, including jobs are only mildly interested in, then you will
get lots of practice at job interviews.  This is good.  It would
be dishonest to interview at a place where you would never go in a
million years.  But don't turn down job interviews at marginal places
unless you really are overwhelmed with better interviews. </p><p>

When you do get invited to an interview, you might panic.  If so
then there are things you can do about it.  Get advice.  Give practice
talks -- several of them, until you can give the talk in your sleep.
Have your friends sit you down for practice interview conversations,
like they'd have with people they were interviewing for real.
Then know that you can do the whole thing on autopilot if necessary.
But also maintain your routine.  Keep making progress on your
dissertation. </p><p>

When you go for a job interview, attitude is important.  Do not think
of the interview as primarily a way to get a job.  That short-term
approach will make you act desperate.  Instead, look at the interview
as an opportunity to establish or deepen long-term professional
relationships with the people in the department.  You need to be
thrilled to meet everyone and find out what they care about.  Some of
the people will be in completely different research areas from you,
but even they will turn out to be connected to you in unexpected ways.
Be open to that and think long-term.  That way you will be relaxed,
and you will feel more comfortable asking them questions as well as
answering theirs. </p><p>

The fundamental principle of an interview for a research-related job
is that you need to be able to establish a point of commonality with
everyone you meet.  Remember how I said that a professional network is
based on the articulation of shared values?  This is similar, except
that you have to do it on your feet.  One more reason to develop your
network is the practice that it will give you at articulating points
of commonality with people, and this is where that skill will be most
handy.  In the old days, a job interview meant establishing this sort
of connection with complete strangers -- believe it or not, it was
often hard to obtain a simple list of the department faculty.  Now we
have the Web, and most job candidates show up for interviews having
memorized the faculty and their research interests.  You should too.
You should also learn in advance about the resources of the university
as they pertain to your research interests; this can mean surfing
the Web, asking friends, or placing calls to the library and archives.
Also find out about relevant research units in other departments.
That way you can answer the question (both for your interviewers and
for yourself) of why there is a good match between you.  But realize
that the real work is going to be done interactionally: you will meet
with the people, you will converse with them, and the main product of
each conversation should be one very clear reason to believe that you
and that person will have something to talk about in the future. </p><p>

More concretely, job interviews usually come in three parts:
the public presentation, individual conversations, and socializing.
At a research-oriented institution, the public presentation is simply
a well-practiced research talk, methodologically airtight, organized
around a single visionary argument, and aimed at a broad nonspecialist
audience.  You might be terrified, in which case you will be
especially happy that you practiced your talk.  Don't get lazy and
prepare it at the last minute.  This is your whole career we're
talking about. </p><p>

The question period after your talk is especially important.  You will
probably get some of the standard questions that challenge you to fill
in seeming holes in the argument, and your history of networking with
diverse people and internalizing their perceptions of your work will
help you deliver the crisp, non-defensive answers that the audience
needs.  But you may also encounter questions that seem completely
random.  You will find yourself answering a question that appears
to have nothing to do with your talk, as if the questioner were too
lazy to understand your talk and were instead asking you to address
some personal hobby-horse.  When this happens, it helps if you
understand what's really going on.  You are not being abused, and
the questioner is not self-absorbed.  Instead, the questioner wants
to know if the two of you share any potential conversation topics.
The real form of the question is, "I'm interested in this, so tell me
how your talk relates to that".  If you draw a blank, adopt a faintly
quizzical but basically delighted tone and say, "that's interesting;
tell me more".  Then look for a point of connection in the response.
Your goal in answering questions, and in all of your interactions with
the people, is <i>not</i> to show how smart you are -- your written
work and your talk have taken care of that -- but to show that you
are an interesting person to converse with.  Blasting people with
the firehose of your overbearing brilliance is not the right approach
at this point.  What you're looking for is a point of contact, just
a single way to make a connection between your interests and those
of the questioner.  You needn't pretend to understand things that
you don't understand, and you needn't chase down every implication
of every question.  Just open up a single topic that builds a bridge
between your interests and theirs.  Once again you will be happy
that you've attended conferences and had plenty of chance to explain
your research to people who don't share all of your premises; the job
talk isn't the best time to discover just how completely people can
misunderstand your work. </p><p>

A job interview typically also includes one-on-one conversations with
faculty and students.  These conversations are usually less stringent
than in the corporate world, but you should certainly have strong
answers ready for the standard interview questions: "Why do you want
to work here?", "What do you have to offer?", "What are your research
plans?", "What is your teaching philosophy?", and so on.  (To get a
sense of how hard-core corporate interviewing works, see Martin Yate,
<i>Hiring the Best</i>.  To learn how to answer the questions, see
Martin Yate, <i>Knock 'em Dead</i>.)  For the most part, though,
your goal in these conversations is the same as with the questioners
after your talks: come away from each conversation with a point of
intellectual contact between the two of you.  It helps if you have
a guess about this point of contact going in, and this is where your
homework helps.  You have more flexibility in these conversations
because they need not be focused narrowly on your research projects.
They can include the person's background, cultural and political
aspects of the department, the students, and other things that
you want to know about.  Sometimes the interviewer will have an
agenda that they want to cover, in which case you should go along
with that, at least at first.  But otherwise you should gently take
control of the conversation.  Find opportunities to tell relevant
information about your career, your work with students, and so on.
Do not conceive of this stuff as advertising.  Do not strain to
say flattering things about yourself, as if you were reciting the
selling points of a product.  Instead, focus on finding something
professionally in common -- one thing -- between yourself and your
interviewer.  Don't be surprised if the people interviewing you have
not read your file and know little about you.  Your candidacy was
probably approved by a committee, and it is a logistical challenge
to get your file to everyone in the department.  So be prepared to
explain yourself to people from scratch. </p><p>

When I say "take control of the conversation", I don't mean that you
should dominate the conversation by talking a lot.  Instead, alternate
between telling facts about your professional life that might provide
points of contact and asking questions that are likely to elicit the
kinds of raw material you need to identify the commonalities you're
looking for.  This may seem daunting at first, especially if you are
talking with someone whose work seems completely unrelated to yours.
But if you just get started, and get practice at it, then you will
find it a lot easier.  Because your interviewers will talk to one
another, you should not repeat the same information to everyone.
Instead, consciously try to have a different conversation with each
person.  For example, with at least a couple of your interviewers you
should display knowledge of, or at least a sincere curiosity about,
the department's curriculum.  A good way to start that conversation is
to ask how course assignments work.  Also make sure you tell someone
your research agenda for the next several years.  They don't know
whether your brilliant dissertation was your own work, or whether you
simply transcribed the ideas of your advisor.  So frame your future
work in a way that builds on the accomplishments of your dissertation
while clearly moving into new territory.  This will be hard because
you're probably still in the depths of the dissertation.  So take time
out to think about this before you arrive.  Try to convey a concrete
sense that you can set up a pipeline that produces refereed journal
articles as its output. </p><p>

In general, try to portray yourself (truthfully) as someone who is
already functioning like an assistant professor.  You need to be
publishing, networking, speaking, organizing professional activities,
and teaching, and you need to have plans for growth and development
in each of those areas.  The result should be a sort of business
plan for your next several years of work, the result of which will
be highly-visible refereed publications that bring glory to you and
your department.  If you can explain that business plan to the people
who are interviewing you, then they will have a clear idea what they
are getting.  In particular, people who work in different research
areas from your own may have a hard time understanding how your work
is important, and this is a prime opportunity to explain how your work
should be evaluated. </p><p>

During the interview, you should not talk about topics that are better
postponed until you get an offer.  This includes salary and benefits,
and it especially includes topics such as course reductions for
research that may make you look less than completely thrilled about
your teaching responsibilities.  See the discussion of negotiation
below for more details about that phase of the process.  During the
interview, however, it probably <i>is</i> useful to open the topic
of what people would expect from you if you want to work there.  You
might approach this topic either very directly (i.e., "if I came to
work here, what would be expected of me?") or very indirectly (e.g.,
by sensing what happens with each individual as you try to articulate
points of commonality with them).  Use your judgement.  Try to discern
whether everyone has the same expectations for you, or whether the
expectations conflict.  For example, you might find yourself in the
middle of a tug-of-war between factions, each of which wants you to
join their projects and ally yourself with their political agendas.
This kind of conflict is not necessarily unmanageable, but you do want
to know about it. </p><p>

The final component of the interview is socializing.  This might take
the form of a reception, or of a meal with some number of the faculty
and students.  The socializing is really just socializing.  So tone
down the intellectual intensity and socialize.  It's still a test,
of course, but it's a test of whether you can tone down the intensity.
Use common sense.  Do not drink alcohol.  Do not talk about deep
personal things.  Do not assume that everybody is your close and
trustworthy friend, just because they are being friendly and polite.
In fact, do not confide in any of your professional acquaintances,
ever.  That's not how it works.  Do not say anything bad about anyone.
Do not get wild and crazy like it's a party.  Do not try to engage in
politics, because you won't be any good at it.  Just socialize.  Get
people to talk about themselves.  If you have kids, then by all means
ask the people about their kids.  Find out about daycare and rent and
culture if that's what you need to know. </p><p>

A common mistake during a job interview is to focus your attention
on the faculty and ignore everyone else.  You need to listen to
the students.  Are they smart?  Mature?  Demoralized?  Excited about
their work?  Engaged in a rebellion?  Just punching the clock until
they get their credential?  What are their complaints?  What agendas
do they bring to the hiring process?  Are you only hearing from the
activists and complainers, or are you hearing representative views?
Try to talk with a group of students without any faculty present.
Very often the most vocal segment of students, who may or may not
represent a majority, have definite ideas about what sort of faculty
are needed -- basically, faculty who can teach the things that they
want to learn and that the current faculty can't teach.  If you can
teach those things then by all means get conversation going on that
topic.  If not then elicit a broader range of issues and concerns
to discover whether that particular topic is the only important one.
In addition, graduate students will often have elaborate views about
the politics of their department.  You can listen to these views as
anthropological data, but in practice students' political analyses
are wildly uneven in quality; some are very astute -- these are smart
people, after all -- but in other cases they just don't have enough
information to develop informed ideas.  So listen to them, but don't
automatically believe or act on what you hear from them. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="picture"> Big picture </a> </strong> </p><p>

Those are the mechanics; now back to the big picture.  Being a job
candidate is inherently strange.  In one sense it is flattering: all
of these interesting and busy people are focusing their attention on
you and your work.  It is an important way to get feedback and thus
build your professional voice.  It is an important way to get a sense
of proportion about the professional world.  To really understand it,
look at it from the point of view of the people who are interviewing
you.  By far the most valuable commodity that any academic department
possesses is job slots.  Things like money and office space (which
is the second most valuable commodity) are relatively fixed, or else
they are in the control of deans and provosts.  But who gets hired is
almost totally under the control of the faculty, and it is absolutely
fundamental to the future workings of the department.  It stands to
reason that people might fight about it, or that they will be looking
for allies or compromises or least worst alternatives.  All of this
political action will be going on under the surface, and you will
be oblivious to most of it.  Of course, if you have a friend in the
department then you will have learned some of it.  But most of it will
be too complicated or subtle or taboo for anyone to explain to you.
</p><p>

So here is the paradox: while you are in town for your interview,
you are the most important person in the whole world, and yet you
cannot know just <i>how</i> you are important.  It's like being an
anthropologist: you sail ashore on an island somewhere, with maybe
a couple of names of contacts and a year spent studying the language
from tapes.  You really don't know the culture that well, and yet
suddenly there you are.  You are fascinating to them, and they are
fascinating to you, but the substance of this fascination is hazy.
You are <i>meaningful</i> to them -- that is, the culture and politics
of the place has assigned you a meaning -- but you don't know what
your meaning is.  You might be seen as a savior, or an invader,
or as a source of cargo from the First World, or as so-and-so's
candidate, or as a snooty person from the Big School on the east
coast.  Most likely different people will perceive you differently,
and their perceptions will be shaped by their relationships to one
another.  On the whole, however, the good news is that nobody will
expect you to understand the culture and politics.  Don't go around
saying things that could trample on land mines and you'll be fine.
Listen both intellectually and intuitively to the people as they talk.
Carefully get them to talk about their history of relations with one
another.  When they tell you something about that history, listen
to their vocabulary and use their words to ask them more questions.
Smile and nod and don't get drawn into topics that you don't know
anything about.  Go ahead and express your own concerns, e.g., "from
what you're saying, should I worry that maybe I, given my background
as such-and-such and my interest in such-and-such, will be treated
as a outsider and not a full member of the group?".  That works fine.
What won't work is expressing opinions about this strange culture,
when you just washed up on the shore this morning.  </p><p>

Here is another way to think about the politics of the academic job
interview.  Think about the faculty members in the department where
you are interviewing, and arrange them along a spectrum.  At one end
are the people whose research interests are closest to yours, and at
the other end are the people whose research interests are furthest
away from yours.  As a broad generalization, faculty want to hire
people whose interests are closer to their own.  And the faculty
decide who to hire by majority vote.  These facts define your task.
With the faculty whose interests are closest to yours, your job is
to develop a deep bond of professional solidarity.  Once they hire
you, they may not be able to hire any more friends for a long time, so
they need to be persuaded that you will be a good collaborator.  With
the people whose interests are furthest from yours, your job is simply
not to get them mad at you.  Find a single point of contact with them,
establish friendly relations, and leave it at that.  The most crucial
people are the ones in the middle -- the faculty whose research areas
are somewhat related to yours.  These are the swing votes, and you
must win them over.  Read their work.  Ask your contacts what they
care about.  Then, when you're on the airplane, think deeply about the
values and directions that you share with each of them, and develop
a sense that you are intellectually on the same team.  Of course, in
the end people will vote for you because you are the best candidate
for the job; no amount of politicking will change that, and your basic
approach to the interview should not be political.  Even so, the best
way to help people appreciate the quality of your work is to converse
with them in their own language. </p><p>

A topic that often preoccupies job candidates is the "culture" of
the department they are joining.  Junior people are often afraid that
they will be isolated in their departments, or that they will have
to contend with a general atmosphere of nastiness.  These concerns
can be valid, but they are often overblown.  First of all, in looking
at a department you should try not to reify an abstraction called "the
culture".  The department is made of individuals, and you will have
dealings with them individually.  Departments do often have customs
and practices, but those things do not define life in the department
in general.  You should also get fears of intellectual isolation in
perspective.  It is better, of course, if you find yourself working in
a department with other people who share your intellectual worldview.
But you should also be investing considerable effort in building an
intellectual network outside of your department.  If you don't have
a network, then isolation is a valid fear.  If you do have a network,
though, then you can draw on your network for intellectual rapport,
comments on draft papers, and things like that.  And over the
long haul, as you become more prominent through your publishing and
networking, you can look for an opportunity to move into a job where
you fit more perfectly. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="negotiating"> Negotiating </a> </strong> </p><p>

The point of all this, of course, is to get job offers.  Know that you
do not have a legally binding job offer until you have a paper letter
in your hand that offers you the job and states the title, salary,
and starting date.  Do not tell anybody that you have a job, do not
reject any options elsewhere, and do not resign from the job that you
currently have until you have this letter in your hand.  A letter that
says "this offer is contingent upon final approval by the Provost,
the Academic Council, and the President" is not a legally binding job
offer until you get written or e-mailed word of that approval. </p><p>

The official job offer letter, however, is only one step in a
complicated process whose details vary a lot depending on the field
and on the personalities of the people involved.  The first and
most momentous step is that the department votes to recommend you
for the job.  When this happens you will receive an informal message
from someone in the department, and there will be much rejoicing.
This is <i>not</i> a legally binding job offer.  When you receive
this message, the correct answer is not "yes" but rather "it's a
great honor that you want to offer me the job, thank you; let's
explore the details".  This is called negotiation, and the results of
the negotiation will go into the job offer.  Negotiating a job offer
is a serious matter.  The intuition is that you will rarely have as
much power as you do right now.  Use it, because once you are hired
you can be ordered to teach courses you don't want to teach, serve
on committees that you don't want to serve on, conduct your research
in lab space that you don't like, and so forth.  So long as your
negotiations with the department remain open, you will have their
undivided attention.  Be polite.  Be business-like.  And be prompt,
because if you turn down the job then they will want to offer it to
someone else.  But do take the opportunity to think carefully and get
yourself the best offer you can. </p><p>

Before you get into the details of the negotiation, you should take
a moment and exhale.  If you're like most people, you've been worrying
about whether you would have a job at all.  Maybe you're going to be
on the street, maybe your children are going to be malnourished, maybe
you will have wasted years of your life, etc.  Now that a department
has announced an interest in hiring you, those anxieties are not going
to vanish in an instant.  Have a party.  Decompress.  Tell yourself
that the worst case scenario, while not perfect, has just gotten a lot
better.  A lot of people would give their teeth to have your problems
now. </p><p>

You should also talk with the department chair at an early point
to find out their process.  Is the formal job-offer letter normally
sent before or after the negotiation?  What kind of word does the
department need from you before they send your file up the hierarchy?
For example, your file might not go to the dean until you say that
you would accept the terms if offered.  What approvals are needed from
that point, and what precedents are there for files being rejected?
Does the chair have to get the file to a committee by a certain date?
Does this mean that you have to complete the negotiation by a certain
date?  At some point you might have to force the chair to walk your
file through the hierarchy, but don't mention that possibility now.
Instead, work together to avoid that sort of crisis, as well as the
sorts of misunderstanding that get reported as "I busted a gut to get
the terms s/he wanted and now s/he's making extra demands". </p><p>

Prepare for the negotiation by talking to the three or four members of
the department with whom you established the best rapport, hopefully
including the most politically astute.  Call them on the phone and
say, "you're probably aware that the department wants to offer me
this job, and I'm hoping to continue our conversation a little bit;
is this a good moment?".  They've interviewed you; now it's your
turn to interview them.  Be polite and low-key.  Don't be arrogant.
Don't get caught digging up dirt, and don't grill anyone like a police
detective.  Don't waste their time.  Stick to the point.  But do get
your questions answered.  If you have practical questions about things
like housing costs and community life, ask them -- one of the norms
of collegiality is that colleagues help one another out with this
sort of practical information.  Ask semi-directive questions about the
topics that concern you.  "What should I know?"  "How does tenure work
there?"  "What is the tenure rate?  Can you tell me about cases where
people didn't get tenure?"  "What is the culture like?"  "How does
everyone get along?"  Then listen to what they say and don't say, and
how real they sound. </p><p>

You should also get advice from your thesis committee members, anyone
else who wrote a letter on your behalf, and your friends inside the
department that wants to hire you.  You should also keep those people
fully informed at each step in the negotiating process.  When talking
to your insider friends, it would be especially helpful to ask them
about local practices.  What sorts of things have previous new hires
negotiated for? </p><p>

When you proceed to actually negotiate the details of the offer, you
should understand what flexibility the department does and does not
have.  A department in a private university will probably have some
flexibility about salary.  The key intuition is that you will only
get the salary that someone else is willing to offer you.  So if you
have other offers (and they'll know if you have other offers) then you
can explore the issue.  A public university will probably have little
flexibility about salary.  (On the other hand, salaries at public
universities are matters of public record, and are sometimes available
on the Web if you look hard.)  The only common way for an entry-level
faculty member in a public university to negotiate about salary is
to consider getting hired at one notch in the promotion scale above
the bottom.  So ask the question, "how does the promotion ladder work
there?".  Oftentimes they will have Assistant Professor I, II, III,
and IV, or whatever.  So maybe you want to be Assistant Professor
II instead of I.  But then maybe you don't, because an Assistant
Professor II might come up for tenure a couple of years earlier than
an Assistant Professor I, and you probably want to delay your tenure
case as long as possible so that you can amass a publication record.
So salary is probably not a major negotiation issue.  If you do want
to negotiate salary, the gist of the problem is for you and your
prospective chair to formulate arguments that will persuade the dean,
whose decision it is.  If nothing else, this is good practice: once
you start work, you will spend a lot of your time working with your
colleagues to formulate arguments that will persuade the dean. </p><p>

As to the other issues, distinguish in your mind between items that
cost money and items that do not cost money but that make the chair's
life harder.  As far as the money is concerned, you should figure
that the chair has a "pot" of somewhere less than $10,000 to spend
on extras for you during your first year.  (That's for a research
university.  I don't know about industry or more teaching-centered
schools.  The amount also depends a lot on the field.  Scientists
need a lot of capital to work, but entry-level historians aren't in
a position to negotiate for much of anything.)  So you are effectively
deciding how to allocate that money.  First find out what comes with
the offer for free.  That might sound like, "I assume the offer comes
with basics like an office with a computer in it".  This is a smart
thing to say, because you don't want your computer to trade off
against other items.  Do the same with technical support for your
computer, and then do it with library access and moving expenses.
Then figure out what else you want for your first year, such as a
laboratory space, a lighter teaching load while you get your research
started, or an assistant.  You might also get someone on your thesis
committee to explain the concept of "summer salary" to you.  You need
to get a research program started, and you should ask the chair for
whatever you will need to hit the ground running.  Much of your first
year will be spent writing grant proposals, and you need the resources
up-front that will let you start doing research and win the research
grants you will need.  It is in the department's interest for you
to succeed in this, but the department will not necessarily know what
your needs are.  So figure them out and negotiate for them.  As an
entry level faculty member you should not invest your ego in getting
a huge amount of stuff from the negotiation.  Just find the optimum
trade-off. </p><p>

Your other area of negotiation does not cost money, but it does make
the chair's life harder.  I'm talking about teaching and committee
assignments.  Much of the chair's job is to fit together a whole batch
of puzzle pieces so that courses get taught and committee work gets
done, among other things, and you are a puzzle piece.  You want to
get assigned to teach courses that you will be good at teaching.  You
also want to be confident that you will be assigned the same course
for several years, so that the massive effort of preparing the course
will be amortized, and so that you can focus more on research in the
crucial few years after you get your research program under way.  So
try to negotiate at least some of your first year's courses.  This may
not be possible at all if it violates local customs, but you can ask.
Consider being assigned to teach a graduate seminar in your research
area, ideally toward the end of your first year, so that you can
recruit graduate students to your projects.  (Your seminar should be
defined <i>not</i> in terms of your specific research topic, but in
terms of the scope, hopefully much wider, of dissertation projects
that you would be willing and able to supervise.)  You should also
negotiate your first-year committee assignments.  Some departments
kill their junior faculty's careers by assigning them difficult
administrative responsibilities.  Find out whether you're dealing with
a department that has a history of this.  You can't negotiate your
courses or committee assignments beyond the first year, but you can at
least get yourself positioned.  The key intuition for committee work
is to define an area of committee work that you really care about,
and get assigned to that.  That area might not even have a name yet.
Avoid the undergraduate and graduate program committees, which involve
heavy lifting.  Organizing the department seminar is a very good idea.
It is usually not a popular job, but it will give you a public role
and help with your networking. </p><p>

One last item.  While you're negotiating your job offer(s), you
need to ask yourself a hard question: will my dissertation really be
done (and that means completely done, printed, signed, and into the
library) by the start date of the job?  The reason I ask is that not
having your dissertation done when you start a new job is a bad idea.
For one thing, the job itself might be contingent on your having a
PhD.  But even if they let you start the job without the dissertation
finished, you will probably regret it.  You'll tell yourself, "I'll
get back to the dissertation once I overcome the enormous blast of
work at the beginning of the new job", but then reality will hit.
That initial blast of work will never end.  And even if it does end,
you'll have lost your current immersion in the dissertation, and it'll
take you months to get back up to speed.  Meanwhile, the tenure clock
is ticking, and all the time you've spent on your dissertation is time
that you're not spending on grant proposals, research projects, and
refereed journal articles.  My point is that you must be realistic
about when your dissertation will be done.  It has already taken longer
than you thought, and the rest of it will take longer than you thought
as well.  You've got a committee of professors looking for problems
with it, you've got trips to the library ahead of you, and you've got
details to pin down.  It's an issue. </p><p>

If you do worry that you might not finish the dissertation on time,
the job negotiation is the right time to face the problem.  You
can say this: "Let's talk for a moment about my dissertation.  It's
coming along very well and I'm pretty confident that it'll be done
on time.  But if something bad happens and it's not done on July 1st
(or whatever the official start date of the job is), what happens?".
Your interlocutor's tone of voice will immediately drop into that
troubled-and-worried range that you have been trying to avoid during
the cheerful interview process, and you will have a scary conversation
about rules and contingencies.  Don't panic.  Remember that these
people have just gotten done persuading themselves that you are the
best person for the job.  They aren't going to blow you off just
because you asked the question.  But they have students that need
teaching, committee work that needs doing, and all the rest of it,
and their lives will become measurably harder if you blow it.  The
best outcome is if you can get an option, written into your offer,
to postpone your start date by a semester.  Or, if you're especially
lucky, they might bring you on as a postdoc for a year with the job
offer still in effect afterwards on the condition that you finish
the dissertation.  Or you might get an ultimatum to finish it or else.
In any case you'll know where you stand.  You certainly don't want
them telling people, "There's a chance that the dissertation won't be
done", so do emphasize that the conversation is hypothetical.  But if
things drag on, don't kid yourself about the reality of the situation.
</p><p>

Once you finish negotiating with the department, your job offer will
probably need to be approved by the university's internal hierarchy.
Actually, these approvals might happen before the negotiation; the
point is that the department itself does not have the authority to
offer you a job.  The hierarchy's approval process does sometimes go
wrong: either the so-called Committee on Academic Personnel doesn't
think you have enough publications, or they are overloaded with other
people's cases, or the department failed to get your file to them on
time.  This is why you shouldn't abandon any other options until you
have an offer letter in your hand.  It is also why you should ensure
that your department has everything it could possibly need to defend
the idea of hiring you: publications, recommendation letters, chapters
of your half-finished book, a copy of your book contract with the
publisher, teaching evaluations, everything.  If you wrote more papers
after the interview (and you should have), definitely send them along.
Unpublished papers count too, provided they're ready to circulate.
And make sure the department has exhaustive and up-to-date contact
information for you, in case a bureaucratic emergency arises. </p><p>

Finally you will get written job offers, hopefully including ones that
you want.  The really hard part comes when you have more than one.  If
the offers all arrive at the same time then you are lucky -- you just
have to pick one.  But if the job offers arrive at different times
then you will find yourself under a great deal of pressure.  You might
get an offer from your fifth-choice department, and they might give
you three weeks to decide, and then two weeks along your first-choice
department is still dawdling.  What do you do?  Well, first you
communicate with everyone.  Tell your first-choice school that you
have another offer that comes with time pressure.  If they want you
then they will speed it up.  Even worse is when your fifth-choice job
offer is about to time out, and you have no other job offers in hand,
but your first choice department says that they can 99% guarantee you
a job offer if you can just wait another week.  This is a tough one,
because if that first-choice job doesn't come through then you're on
the street.  So what do you do?  Well, hopefully you have prepared
for this amazingly common situation by having a one-year postdoc
or visiting position in your pocket as a fall-back.  But let's say
you haven't.  Then you should try to delay the fifth-choice people
another week, and if you can't delay them then you should take their
job, figuring that maybe you'll move somewhere else once you become
established.  Why?  Because that so-called 99% guarantee from your
first-choice department is probably more like 50%.  It's in their
interest to delude themselves about how likely they are to offer you
a job because they lose nothing if they're wrong. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="job-conclusion"> Getting advice </a> </strong> </p><p>

When looking for a job, and especially when negotiating a job offer,
you will probably be asking for a great deal of advice -- maybe
more serious advice than you have ever gotten in your life.  It will
therefore be helpful to think about the general problem of getting
advice.  You should get advice from a wide variety of people.  The
reason for this is straightforward: in giving advice, people tend to
overgeneralize from their own experience.  Few people are excellent
advice-givers; the real distinction is between people who can get a
little distance on their own experience and people who can't.  You
should try to determine each person's strengths and weaknesses as an
advice-giver, and try to adjust accordingly. </p><p>

One way to interpret various advice-givers' strengths and weaknesses
is in terms of their structural location.  Relying only on your thesis
committee will give you advice-givers who are steeped in one culture.
They will probably advise you as if where you are going resembles the
culture in which you've been trained.  The advice you will get from
assistant professors is almost always useless; very junior people
are often unable to attend the most important meetings, and they
are generally too anxious about their own positions to help you much.
People are generalizing from their experience.  But practices vary
from one field to another, and so the advice you get will also vary
depending on the advice-giver's field.  For example, a field that is
oversupplied with well-qualified job candidates will probably have
different practices than one where qualified candidates are rare.
Most people are unaware of the degree of variation among fields, and
so they may not realize that their experience doesn't generalize. </p><p>

It's especially important to attend to the distinctions between junior
and senior people.  For junior people, the experience of negotiating
an offer is still fresh in mind.  As such, their advice is more likely
to reflect current practice.  Senior people, by contrast, probably
travel and network a great deal, so they can be useful as sources of
intelligence, but they may not have negotiated an offer for decades.
Things have generally gotten more competitive since the 1970's, and
so it is common for senior people to have an excessively sunny outlook.
At the same time, junior people often have an excessively cynical
outlook.  Some people take these polar attitudes to an extreme, and
you should ignore any advice you get from people (mostly senior) who
think academe is all about the disinterested pursuit of truth, as well
as from people (mostly junior) who think it's all politics.  People
with mature outlooks fall into the realistic middle between these
extremes, and you should consciously identify those mature individuals
and make professional friends with them. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="job-conclusion"> Conclusion </a> </strong> </p><p>

That, then, is how to get a job.  If you are reading this as a
new graduate student, it probably sounds completely foreign.  "How
could I ever do all of that, when right now I'm just focused on the
insane reading list I have to study for my qualifying exams?"  It's
a good question, but the answer is that everything comes in its time.
Read this article again when you are writing your first conference
paper on your research, and then read it again once a year.  You will
be impressed with how different it seems from year to year, and how
much more sense the institutions will make once you start to become
part of them. </p><p>

</p><h3> <strong> <a name="section7">SECTION 7.  Advising Others</a>
</strong> </h3> <p>

Once you get a job, and probably long before, your status in the
community will quietly shift: you'll no longer be the disoriented
student at the bottom of the totem pole, and others will be coming
to you for advice.  That's particularly true if you've been building
a network, organizing professional activities, and projecting a sense
of purpose in your career.  Perhaps you are not yet anyone's official
dissertation advisor, but you are an advisor in an informal sense,
with a chance to do good and a risk of doing harm.  You need to see
the situation coming, because being in a position to give advice can
evoke strange reactions.  If you have any latent tendencies to be an
empire-builder, power freak, meddler, or know-it-all, now is when they
will come out.  It will take a little time before you get comfortable
with the role, so in the meantime here are some concepts and rules.
</p><p>

 * Figure out whether you are being asked for advice at all.  Often
people who have troubling situations just want to talk about them,
either to sort out the situation emotionally or just to rant.  Maybe
you're just supposed to sit there and say nothing, which if you're
like me will be good for you.  It is very common to hallucinate that
you are being asked for advice when you are not.  Giving unwanted
advice is a serious and widespread character defect.  It is a good
practice, therefore, to ask "do you want advice?" or "are you asking
for advice?".  Don't make it sound like you are bursting with advice
that you can't wait to spill out.  If the answer is "no", shrug
and say "okay" and be done with it.  Regardless of the answer, the
situation will be clarified in both of your minds. </p><p>

 * Decide in advance whether you are qualified to give people
advice about personal matters, or just about professional matters.
Most people are terrible at the former.  In either case, be clear
in your own mind whether the matter is personal, professional, or a
combination of both.  People's situations usually have both aspects,
especially early in their careers before they have themselves all
established and compartmentalized, so you may have to say things
like, "well, that's a personal aspect of the situation that I can't
really help with". </p><p>

 * Understand the different structural situations that might cause the
person to need advice.  The hardest and most important case is when
the person is just entering into a new institutional setting (such as
the early years of graduate school) or else making the transition to a
very different location within the institution (such as when starting
their first faculty job).  In that case, what's really needed is a
general orientation to an unfamiliar landscape.  You're inside and
they're outside, and they're still clueless.  Your major obstacle
is that you've forgotten what that clueless feeling is like.  Try
to remember, though, because your job is to provide the person with
a way of looking at things.  Try to explain, concisely and in plain
language, the logic of the world they're entering, so they can see
what's going on around them.  Provide a sense of proportion.  "Is
this situation normal?"  "Can this be done?"  Another possibility,
very different and much easier, is that the person understands the
unwritten rules of the institution just fine, and needs advice simply
because you know particular facts.  Perhaps you are acquainted with
particular individuals and can provide advice about dealing with them.
Explain what those individuals care about, what concerns they are
likely to have, what misperceptions are liable to set them off, what
agendas they have going on, and so forth.  Yet another possibility is
that you're being asked for guidance, either step-by-step instructions
or an intuitive sense of proportion, on a specific process that you
have been through, such as organizing a workshop.  Figure out what
kind of advice you are being asked for, confirm your understanding
with the person, and then advise accordingly. </p><p>

 * Realize the limits of your expertise.  Learn how to say "I don't
know" without feeling insecure.  Practice phrases like "I'm at the
edge of my expertise here, and you might want to talk to X or Y who
has done more of this than I have".  Learn to detect the feeling
inside yourself when you cease knowing what you're talking about and
start making things up instead.  Notice how good it feels to know what
you're talking about, and how good it feels to refrain from making
things up. </p><p>

 * Clarify the situation.  Make sure you've got the facts before
you start issuing directions.  The person you're advising may not
even be clear as to the nature of the situation, and you may well
find yourself turning up important facts that completely change the
picture.  This is particularly true when you're being asked to help
impose order on chaos, as for example when the question is "What
should I do with my life?".  Understand whether the crucial facts
are about the person asking for help, about some public situation
such as a bureaucratic process, about third parties, about technical
machinery, or whatever.  Some situations are clearer than others,
and when the situation is unclear you should settle down to extended
elicitation of facts.  Decide whether you should be asking directive
questions (that is, questions that presuppose that you know what the
real issue is) or semi-directive questions (that is, questions that
are fairly vague and are really aimed at getting the person talking
so that you can listen to their language and the way they're talking).
An example of a directive question is, "have you registered for the
course?"; an example of a semi-directive question is, "how did you
decide to take the course?".  Sometimes it's useful for the person
to wander around exploring different aspects of the situation, and
sometimes it's not.  It's up to you to discern the difference. </p><p>

 * Find out what's behind the question.  People often don't know
how to ask their question, or because they don't understand their
situation they are asking the wrong question.  If a graduate student
asks you how to start a journal, for example, you can probably guess
that the question is wrong.  Even when the question is right, you
usually want to know what motivated it.  So unless the question is
really clear-cut, don't launch into an answer until you have elicited
the broader background that motivated it.  Maybe your advice will be
to ask other questions. </p><p>

 * If the person is having trouble with a decision, find out if they
know what they want to do with their life.  I've mentioned that "what
should I do with my life?" involves imposing order on chaos, and you
can hardly believe how true this is until you start talking to people
about it.  Some people tolerate the chaos perfectly well, and they
are happy pursuing what interests them from day to day or year to
year.  Other people, however, live in a constant state of distress
because of it, and those people need help.  When people can't decide
what to write their term papers about, for example, I find that
they are actually uncertain what their life is about.  Just ask them:
"what do you want to do with your life?".  They will probably shrug
and giggle.  They have no idea.  I believe that someone who is living
in that kind of chaos is incapable of learning, and so I regularly
turn conversations about term paper topics into conversations about
career plans.  I don't require anyone to make any irreversible
commitments, but I do urge them to come up with a tentative plan that
they can explore through their term paper.  The same principle applies
to many other decisions.  Now, some people don't want a plan for their
lives, and insist on living in state of permanent chaos.  That's their
right, but it's also my right to tell those people nicely that I don't
know how to help them. </p><p>

 * Cultivate your powers of finding things interesting.  If you are
like most of us, you will need to learn how to distinguish your own
interests from other people's.  If someone is looking for direction,
the worst thing you can do is to foist your own direction on them.
Most such foisting is unconscious: you may not intend to manipulate
anyone into following your own path rather than theirs, but if you
have sewn yourself into the narrow world of your dissertation then
you may not even recognize that other paths exists.  Get used to
the fact that some people want to make money, and that other people
are interested in research methodologies that are quite different
from your own, and that still other people are much more interested
in theory than you are, or much less.  Most people couldn't care
less about the research literatures that fascinate you, and that's
okay.  In advising others, you have an opportunity to expand yourself
by searching out and articulating a vision of greatness for someone
else's life.  You have to start by believing that everyone, including
the person you are advising, is capable of making a tremendous
contribution to the world.  That tremendous contribution is inside
them somewhere, it's trying to get out, and if you are advising
someone who is looking for direction then your job is to identify
that tremendous contribution and get excited about it.  Figure out
what the person is interested in.  Elicit bits and pieces of their
interests, then offer various alternative directions that they could
pursue, and ask them which alternatives strike a chord.  The process
is like tuning a radio: you are going to fiddle with the dial until
the person's tremendous-contribution-in-the-making comes through
loud and clear.  Share that person's excitement, and enthusiastically
preach the importance of their vision.  Their path won't always be
easy, and your articulate and persuasive confidence will help keep
them on track.  In particular, you can help them by acting as a
translator between their world and the professional world that they
want to join, explaining their vision to them in professional-sounding
language.  Sell them their own lives.  And whatever you do, don't go
around discouraging people, or telling them that they can't cut it.
Your question should be "what does this person down-deep care about?",
because that is where their greatest contribution will lie.  It's not
your job to go around trashing people's dreams, because you're not
that smart. </p><p>

 * Don't try to tell people what to work on.  If someone is looking
for help identifying a research topic, your advice should remain on
the level of process, not substance.  Research topics are extremely
personal, and a topic that interests you is not likely to interest
anyone else.  You can mirror back someone's topic in an interesting
way, but you can't devise a topic from scratch.  What you can
do, however, is to offer a few potential topics as probes into the
person's interests.  You can say, "okay, just to help me get a sense
of your interests, let me just make up a few topics off the top of
my head, and you can tell me which ones are more and less interesting,
and why".  Note that you are deliberately downplaying your own
investment in the topics you suggest. </p><p>

 * Try not to offer evaluations.  Only rarely will anyone ever
ask you, "how good is my writing" or "how good is my research".  If
you think you are being asked for an objective evaluation like this,
stop and think.  Either you are really being asked, "should I change
careers?", in which case you should explore that question in the
thorough way that it deserves, or you are being asked, "what are some
specific ways in which I can improve my writing/research?", in which
case you can treat the question very narrowly and positively without
offering any kind of overall assessment. </p><p>

 * It's not about you.  In offering advice to someone else, you may
be tempted to use your own experiences as examples.  Don't.  Stories
about your life will not communicate anything useful.  If you have
learned any lessons from your experiences, then that's great; you
can explore how (and whether) those lessons apply to the particulars
of the other person's life.  But leave your life out of it.  This
rule has only one exception.  Often someone will be distressed because
they're going through a crisis that lots of people go through.  You
can help them feel better by saying, "yeah, I know, I went through
that; lots of people do", and leaving it at that -- just a few words.
</p><p>

 * Don't be a jerk.  Many people use "frank advice" as an excuse to be
obnoxious.  Have a caring purpose.  This means saying things because
they are going to help someone get a clear understanding and their own
direction, not just because they are true. </p><p>

 * Understand which words belong to you and which belong to the
person you're advising.  For example, if you are serving as a
bureaucratic authority (e.g., an instructor in a course) then it is
your job to understand and adjudicate the meanings of the relevant
bureaucratic words.  On the other hand, if the person is telling you
about their life, or about a world that you are not a part of, they
will often introduce words that you do not control, and whose full
meaning you can probably never know.  I'm not just talking about
five-syllable jargon words, but ordinary simple words that might or
might not carry special connotations for particular people.  Don't
try to take control of such words.  Don't presuppose that you know
what they mean, and do not try to impose your own meaning upon them.
Nothing kills communication faster.  Instead, incorporate those words
into questions aimed at eliciting a fuller picture of the situation.
For example, if the person says, "I want a meaningful job", you have
no idea what "meaningful" means to them.  But you can ask a question
like, "what would a meaningful job be like?", or "who comes to mind
that has a job that's meaningful in the way you'd like?".  This can
get condescending if you do it wrong, but once you have the concept
of not legislating what "meaningful" means you'll figure it out. </p><p>

 * Be a mirror.  Make clear what you know and don't know.  Check your
understanding by saying, "let me check my understanding by trying to
explain that back to you in my own words", doing so, and saying, "is
that right?".  This is called active listening, and it accomplishes
many things, such as preventing you from saying dumb things, eliciting
any further information you might need, and tactfully showing the
person how well they are expressing themselves.  Own your perceptions
and feelings by saying things like, "my sense is ..." and "I perceive
you as being unclear on ...".  Emphasize the evidentiary basis of
your comments by saying things like, "I hardly know you, so what I'm
saying is based only on what you've told me and on the impressions
I'm getting here".  It may sound like a platitude, but it's not.  It
makes clear that you do not have a magical ability to read anybody's
mind, and that you understand your limitations. </p><p>

 * Know your feelings.  Let's say that you're listening to someone's
problems and you start feeling angry (or sad, or confused, or
itching to get out of there).  Although I don't want you to engage
in psychoanalysis or start talking about your feelings in a way that
would take the focus off the person you're advising, it will be useful
if you can notice the feeling and start to identify it.  The first
step, which is harder than it sounds, is actually becoming aware of
the feeling.  If you're feeling angry and you start yelling, then
that's a good sign that you're acting on the feeling rather than
consciously observing it.  Once you become consciously aware of the
feeling, try to locate where in your body you are feeling it.  Is
it in your stomach?  Your jaw?  Take a moment to feel the feeling,
and ask yourself whether the feeling is familiar.  Is this something
you commonly feel?  Once you get a fix on the feeling, you can ask
yourself some questions about it: </p><p>

  (1) Whose feeling is it?  When giving someone advice, it's common
to feel that person's feelings instead of your own.  Either you are
feeling a natural empathy, or else the person is unconsciously trying
to shift their own feelings onto you.  This is especially common with
feelings of confusion, and if you become confused while giving someone
advice then you should definitely stop and consider whether it's your
own confusion or theirs. </p><p>

  (2) Is the feeling rational?  That is, are you angry (sad,
frightened, confused, etc) about the actual, real situation that's
happening there in the room, or has something about that situation
poked an emotional wound that you're carrying around from an unrelated
situation?  For example, if you are advising someone who is being
oppressed, you might start to get angry (or whatever) because you're
unconsciously calling up memories of your own unresolved experiences
of being oppressed.  Feelings from unrelated situations are rarely
useful, and you should try to file them and return to the business at
hand.  Deal with them later on your own time. </p><p>

  (3) Who is the feeling directed toward?  You might be angry (or sad,
frightened, confused, etc) toward the person you are advising, for
example because the person's actual agenda is not to get advice but to
manipulate you.  If so then you'll have to decide whether to proceed,
and how.  Or you might be angry (etc) toward some third party that
the person is telling you about.  In that case you need to file that
feeling for later and proceed in a rational, analytical way, since
your job is to be useful, not angry. </p><p>

Once you have identified the feeling in these ways, you will have to
decide what to do about it.  The point, again, is not to launch into
extended psychological discussions.  You probably don't have the
training for that.  You could simply explain that you're having the
feeling and what you think is causing it.  You can even say that
you're mentioning this precisely because you want to stick to rational
analysis of the situation.  Or you can simply use the feeling as a
source of data as you decide how to proceed with the conversation.
In any case, the simple act of identifying the feeling will make you
less likely to act irrationally on it. </p><p>

 * Take a different approach when advising someone who is distraught.
A person who is acutely emotionally upset (failed an exam, might get
thrown out of school, whatever) is temporarily incapable of rational
thought.  That's not their fault, and you shouldn't blame them for it.
To the contrary, you should accommodate their situation by not doing
or saying anything that demands rational thought from them.  Don't
try to explain things or solve problems.  Don't say "I know how you
feel".  Just listen for a while.  See if you can make yourself into a
container where they can put all the junk until they are in a position
to process it.  When the time comes to put the pieces back together,
have them walk through the facts of the situation.  Simply saying the
facts, without any attempt to evaluate or change them, is the first
step to reestablishing rational thought.  Concreteness is important.
Watch for any tendencies to blur the facts with hazy language, or
to speak in abstractions.  Watch for attempts to conflate logically
unrelated situations into a big ball of distressing emotions.
These are defenses against dealing with the reality.  Also watch
for attempts to conflate simple statements of the facts with extra,
additional judgements about what those facts imply -- such conflations
are a very important sign that the person is not dealing with reality
yet.  Of course, maybe it's not time to deal with reality yet, and
that's not for you to decide.  But if it's time to reason about the
situation, then you can do a service by keeping things on a rational
track.  Prioritize.  Ask questions that will let you distinguish
between issues that really need to be decided right now and issues
that can wait.  Don't get sidetracked worrying about facts that have
no bearing on the issues that need to be decided first.  Once you've
reestablished the rhythms of rational discussion, you can resume
applying the rest of the strategies I've presented here. </p><p>

 * Be clear whether the situation calls for you to offer specific
instructions.  Usually it does not.  Everyone has their own path,
and you probably can't have enough information to know what course
is actually best, given the full context of their life.  It is
important to understand this, because otherwise you are likely to get
yourself too committed to the solution that happens to occur to you.
Some people just want reactions, perspectives, options, issues, and
reassurance that they're not crazy.  They can figure the rest out for
themselves.  Other people want detailed instructions.  You'll have
to figure out who wants what. </p><p>

 * If you start to suspect a hidden agenda, stop, and don't continue
until you have clarified the situation.  Some people want advice so
they can blame you if your advice, which they plan on following in
only the most narrow way, doesn't work.  Some people pretend to want
advice so they can resist it.  Some people are really there to get
you to say that they are right and someone else is wrong.  Most people
with agendas will never admit them, and it probably won't do any good
for you to accuse them of anything.  But if you determine that your
time is not being used in good faith, simply say that you don't know
how to help them.  And let it go. </p><p>

 * If you find yourself pressuring, manipulating, or arguing, then
something has gone wrong.  You can state your views, but let go of
your desire to control anyone.  Other people are responsible for their
actions and have to make their own decisions.  You can give them
factual information and state your own opinions (e.g., by saying
"my opinion is ..."), but trying to control them won't help and will
probably cloud their thinking.  If their decision affects you then you
are not giving advice but negotiating, which is extremely different.
If you are actually negotiating then this must be made clear all
around.  Recruiting someone to join your research group or department,
for example, is a kind of negotiation.  Likewise, you should realize
if you have any conflicts of interest, for example when the topic
is whether the student ought to be working for you.  Sometimes the
conflicts are not obvious, and in that case you should obviously
disclose them.  But if your interests really aren't affected, then
realize that and let go of needing to fix the outcome. </p><p>

 * Giving advice is often iterative.  You'll offer advice, but your
advice will cause other facts and issues to surface, such as the
reasons why your advice won't work.  That's fine.  Just start another
round of clarifying the situation.  And once you understand that
advice is iterative, you'll be more likely to frame your advice in a
conditional way, like "okay, how about if you ..., would that work?".
</p><p>

 * Talk in usefully medium-sized units.  Don't give long speeches.
If your advisee is filling up with comments or resistance as you talk
then your talking isn't doing any good anyway.  If they seem to want
to talk, stop talking, because they aren't listening.  By the same
token, if your head fills up with things to say while the person
is talking, make notes.  Then just say the one that's most important.
It's okay to say "hang on, I need to keep notes to keep track of
this".  If you can't get around to saying everything that you want
to say, you can always follow up with an e-mail letter if necessary.
Or you can just forget it.  You don't need to present a complete,
seamless picture.  Just say enough to get the person thinking on their
own again, then stop.  You can check understanding with something
like "is this making any sense?".  This is better than "do you
understand?", since it puts the blame on you and doesn't presuppose
that you <i>are</i> making sense.  An even better question is, "do I
understand?", since that's a more common problem anyway. </p><p>

 * Get to the point.  Don't start into a philosophical speech whose
connection to the issue at hand is not going to be revealed until
it's almost done.  If you do have to explain an abstract concept,
say so first: "I guess to explain this I have to introduce an abstract
concept, okay?".  The person you're advising is focused on their
problem, and they don't have the attention span for anything whose
relation to the problem has not been made clear.  Concisely explain
your thought processes. </p><p>

 * Don't ask questions unless you want to know the answers.  Don't ask
"quiz questions" whose answers you already know.  Making someone read
your mind teaches all the wrong lessons. </p><p>

 * Practice explaining things.  When you see someone pursuing their
career in an admirably effective way, stop and figure out what
they are doing.  The concepts in "Networking on the Network" should
help.  Then pretend that you are explaining the admirably effective
strategies you are seeing.  Rehearse the actual words that you would
use to make these strategies comprehensible to someone who still feels
clueless.  If you do this consistently then your rehearsals will come
back to you automatically some day when it's your turn to give advice.
You will also start to notice analogies and patterns among the various
admirable strategies you observe, and this will help you to develop
your own concepts. </p><p>

 * If you find yourself giving the same advice over and over, write
it down.  This happens a lot when you're dealing with lots of people
who are all in basically the same situation, such as students in your
class.  Most of them will never ask you for advice, even though most
of them need it.  By writing your advice down, you save everyone's
time and spread the benefits of your wisdom to more people.  Then
keep adding to your emerging how-to every time a new issue comes up.
That's where this article came from.  Not only that: every time I see
a student feeling bad or getting into trouble, I ask myself whether
the necessary advice is in this article, and if it isn't I add another
sentence, paragraph, or section. </p><p>

</p><h3> <strong> <a name="section8">SECTION 8.  How to Get Tenure</a>
</strong> </h3> <p>

A professor once told me that getting tenure is like not getting
hit by a train.  What she meant is that what matters psychologically
is the prospect of being denied tenure.  Coming up for tenure is
generally stressful, and this stress causes many people to distort
their lives and their research in an attempt to second-guess a tenure
process that they do not experience as rational.  My goal here is
to explain the process of getting tenure in a way that relieves the
stress and makes such distortions unnecessary. </p><p>

<strong> Deep tenure </strong> </p><p>

People who are starting out in their first job as a professor often
misunderstand their relationships with the other faculty in their
department.  They are looking for some kind of community among equals,
and they are often surprised to find their colleagues investing most
of their attention in the outside world.  The junior faculty feel
that they need to work closely with the senior faculty who will decide
their tenure cases, or at least they will invest effort in politicking
those senior faculty in an attempt to influence the eventual decision.
Much of this effort is misdirected.  Of course, senior faculty do
exist who ignore junior faculty or treat them callously.  But you
should understand that a department of a research university is not
the sort of village that Tocqueville idealized.  Instead, it is more
like an alliance of entrepreneurs, each of them moving and shaking
in the larger world as well as within their departments. </p><p>

Once you understand your department in those terms, the question of
tenure changes.  Getting tenure in your department is good, but more
important is getting deep tenure: a thoroughgoing integration of
yourself and your career into your field as a whole.  I have already
explained most of the process, which is nothing but publishing,
articulating commonalities, networking, identifying emerging themes,
organizing activities, and so on.  Once you obtain deep tenure, your
university would be foolish to lose you.  And if your university does
in fact fumble your tenure case, deep tenure means that you are nearly
certain to have another good job waiting for you somewhere else.
If you put enough effort into networking, and if you shift your
psychology away from your department and toward your field as a whole,
then the process of getting tenure will be much less distressing.
You will be less likely to waste valuable time in excess politicking
of your immediate colleagues.  And you will be able to relate to your
colleagues as fellow movers and shakers rather than as neighbors in
an idealized village.  In particular, your independent standing in the
field, because of your widespread network, will increase your autonomy
and make you less open to manipulation by others. </p><p>

The best news of all is that getting tenure and getting deep tenure
are more or less the same process.  Here is how it works.  When you
come up for tenure, or for any other career review, your tenure case
will be decided by people who lack deep knowledge of your research
area.  Therefore -- and this is a basic mechanism of the university
on all levels -- they will necessarily seek out evidence of your
research accomplishments other than your own estimate or theirs.
One common measure is where and how much you have published in peer
reviewed venues such as refereed journals and scholarly publishers.
So of course you should publish a lot, with your main emphasis on
those kinds of outlets as opposed to nonacademic publications and
unrefereed chapters in edited books. </p><p>

More important than publication, though, will be the letters that your
department will get from senior people in your research area.  For
that reason, your tenure campaign should be very much organized around
those people.  This means networking, very much as I have described
it above, but with a more systematic approach.  It couldn't be simpler.
Make a list of the twenty people whom your department is most likely
to get letters from.  These will be senior people whose work is
widely known, and who are known themselves as the leading figures in
particular areas.  Make sure that every important aspect of your work
is covered by this list.  Then set out to build strong professional
relationships with every one of those people in the ways that I
have been describing in previous sections.  This is easier than it
sounds.  By the time you come up for tenure, you may have had three
or four conversations with each person on your list.  That may not
sound like much.  But if you have been working the process in the
right way then that will be plenty.  When your tenure case approaches,
your university will probably ask you for a list of suggested
referees, and you should discuss with your colleagues which names
would work best on your list.  You can also ask the individuals
involved whether they would be willing to write a letter if they
are asked.  (You don't <i>have</i> to ask them, though.  They understand
perfectly well how the institution works.)  The specifics can be
complicated here, depending on how your university's tenure process
works.  For example, your department might be obligated to write to
several people who are not on your list, in which case you might want
to restrict your list to the people whom your department finds less
obvious.  But the relationships with likely letter-writers will be
the most important element of your tenure case in any event.  And as
you do develop relationships with the twenty people on your list, make
sure to explain those people to the people in your department who do
not know your field well. </p><p>

<strong> Getting a distinct identity </strong> </p><p>

Closely related to deep tenure is a second element, which is getting
a clear and distinct professional identity.  When your university is
deciding whether to give you tenure, they want to make sure that they
are evaluating you, as opposed to evaluating your thesis advisor or
the people you have collaborated with.  If you have worked closely
with your advisor, or if your dissertation and related work will sound
similar to your advisor's work, then you will need to get a distinct
identity.  Start research projects in different areas from your
advisor, explain your work in different language than your advisor
uses, and find ways to clearly mark off your work from your advisor's,
for example by explaining your new work as a clear step beyond the
work that the two of you published together.  You don't just want
to have different research results than your advisor -- you want a
clearly distinct research agenda. </p><p>

Establishing a distinct professional identity also means limiting the
amount of work that you coauthor with your peers and with other people
who are more senior than you.  This is unfortunate, of course, but
the institution needs to evaluate you as an individual.  Work that
you coauthor with your students is not a problem, since the committees
will assume that you were the intellectual leader in the project,
and you can coauthor some work with senior members of your department,
since they will be able to explain your distinct role to the people
who review your file. </p><p>

To have a clear and distinct identity, finally, you need to be able to
explain your research agenda.  Your explanation should not sound like
anyone else's, and it should convey a clear sense that a great deal
of useful research can be done by following that agenda in the future.
To explain your agenda in a clear and distinct way does not mean that
you should devalue the work of others before you.  To the contrary,
you should articulate a historical narrative of the research that you
are building on, so that everyone can understand precisely how your
work is different from what has come before.  Giving credit to others
should not detract from your own identity. </p><p>

<strong> Organizing around an emerging theme </strong> </p><p>

The most basic way of getting a distinct identity is to articulate an
emerging theme in your field.  In other words, you don't just want to
set an agenda for your own research -- you want to catalyze a social
movement within your field by organizing activities among the people
whose research fits the theme.  I have already discussed the basics of
this process in Section 3.  Now, however, organizing around emerging
themes has become crucial to your career.  So let me explain the
process in more detail. </p><p>

When you are conducting and writing about your research, and
especially when you are writing about how your work complements 
that of others, you should continually brainstorm emerging themes.
Work them out in your notebook, and in your conversations with others
in your field, until you find one that works.  Let us consider an
example.  Suppose that you are conducting research on a group of
biologists who use the Internet to collaborate in new ways.  If you
are not thinking clearly, you might assume that the particular group
you are studying is unique, and that none of the themes you are
identifying in your research are relevant to the research of others.
After all, the people you are studying probably <i>are</i> unique
in many ways.  If you have developed the custom of searching for
emerging themes, though, and if you are networking and reading other
people's work, then you will notice that other researchers are also
studying groups who collaborate over the Internet.  You might then
coin a phrase such as "distributed collective practice" to describe
the larger category that your own project shares with these others.
More precisely, you might fill your notebook with dozens of phrases,
one of which, in this case "distributed collective practice", will
sound especially felicitous. </p><p>

"Distributed collective practice" happens to be a real example of
an emerging theme, and you can find the proceedings of a workshop
on distributed collective practice by searching the Web with Google.
As emerging themes go, "distributed collective practice" is especially
well-designed.  It has several properties.  First of all, it sounds
good.  It has a nice poetic gallop to it.  Just as importantly, each
of its words -- "distributed", "collective", and "practice" -- has a
meaning for the researchers, so that grouping the three words together
combines things that are deeply familiar in a way that is striking
and new.  The phrase is also quite general.  It brings together
the community you want -- that is, a community whose members, while
diverse, share a substantial number of ideas and values.  For example,
you may have been studying biologists in your research, but in devising
your emerging theme you have chosen to reach out toward all collective
practices, not just biology and not just science.  Likewise, you may
have have been studying people who collaborate on the Internet, but
you have chosen to generalize your emerging theme so that it applies to
all distributed activities, not just ones that happen on the Internet.
And so on. </p><p>

Of course, you could have articulated your emerging theme differently.
You could have said "Internet knowledge production" or "information
technology in science" or "social networks and institutional change".
Each of these formulations could very well identify an emerging theme
around which a new research community could coalesce.  But you chose
the formulation that identified the particular community that you
found congenial and that was ready to be identified.  How did you
know that a community was ready to be identified using that particular
phrase?  Because you know many of the people individually.  You have
conversed with them, read their work, perhaps participated in joint
activities with them.  You have worked to articulate commonalities
with them, some of which may have grown directly into potential
emerging themes for a larger group.  You have internalized their
thinking to some degree, and you can anticipate to some degree how
they will perceive things.  Having articulated your best guess at the
theme that is emerging in their work, you have also consulted with
them in the manner that I described in Section 3. </p><p>

You should try to generalize your emerging theme as much as possible
-- "distributed collective practice" as opposed to "biologists working
together on the Internet".  This is crucial.  In articulating an
emerging theme, you are claiming a certain territory, and you might
as well claim as much territory as possible.  I have already mentioned
that your research papers resemble patent applications, and the same
thing goes for your emerging themes, whose claims should stretch
out in every direction until they collide with the claims that have
already been made by others.  The point is not that you actually
own all of the resesarch in that territory.  You are not claiming
intellectual property in any official sense.  Other people will get
credit for the results of their own research within that territory.
You are, however, claiming credit for noticing the general theme,
articulating its significance, mapping its issues, organizing the
people who are working within it, and setting the agenda for future
research within it.  Having done this, you will be identified as
a leader.  And being a leader is the best, most reliable way to get
deep tenure. </p><p>

Organizing activities around emerging themes teaches you a deep lesson
about the profession of research: research means doing something
new, and the research community, when it is functioning at all, is
thoroughly dynamic, always changing, always fluid.  In getting tenure,
your job is not to break into an existing network.  If some existing
institution tries to exclude you, ignore it.  Your job is to build the
new institutions that will organize the research community for a new
generation of researchers.  It's not hard.  You just have to do
it. </p><p>

<strong> Your department's tenure process </strong> </p><p>

Having discussed deep tenure on the level of your field as a whole,
it is now possible to think clearly about the tenure process within
your own department.  It is entirely reasonable for you to ask your
departmental colleagues what are the criteria for tenure.  Go ahead
and ask several of them, preferably ones who are both closest to you
and central to the department's social networks.  When you do this,
you will discover the phenomenon of folk theories about tenure.  For
example, you might be told that you need to publish two books, or that
you need to place an article in such-and-such journal, or that writing
for nonacademic publications actually counts negatively at tenure time
rather than counting as zero or as a slight positive under the heading
of service to the community.  You might get well-meaning advice to
postpone this, that, or the other aspect of your professional life
until after you have gotten tenure.  You will be torn: half of you
will find these folk theories to be ridiculous, which of course they
are, and the other half of you will start frantically rearranging your
whole career to conform to them.  Once you gather these theories and
start pondering them, ask around about whether, when, and how they
are applied in practice.  You may find that every one of your senior
colleagues has a different folk theory in mind.  Or you may learn
that faculty meetings to discuss tenure cases are actually organized
around one or more of these folk theories, so that they have become
institutionalized.  In my view, you should only change your plans
slightly to accommodate the folk theories.  The most important thing
is to publish high-quality research in refereed journals and book
series, the second is to get deep tenure in your field, the third
is to build professional relationships with the faculty in your
department, the fourth is to teach reasonably well, and the fifth is
not to stress out about it.  That's it. </p><p>

Whatever you do, ignore the folk theories that you hear from untenured
faculty members.  Untenured faculty members simply do not have the
information that they would need to theorize the process.  Don't
get into any alcohol-fueled sessions of mutual sharing of uninformed
theorizing about tenure.  Don't discuss tenure with people who
say things like, "there is a hierarchy, and you need to recognize it
and be deferent toward it".  Don't validate anyone else's negativity.
Don't overinterpret stories about the reasons why other people failed
to get tenure -- you will probably not be hearing the whole story.
And don't take sides in factional politics.  Just calmly articulate
commonalities with everyone and have pity on people who project
their psychological dramas onto the professional world around them.
If powerful people in your department try to force you to join their
clique rather than someone else's, your answer is always the same:
articulate commonalities.  They more they lean on you, the more you
should work with them to articulate commonalities.  Articulating
commonalities is always a useful activity.  It builds your intellect,
and it builds relationships.  It cements political alliances without
precluding equally strong political alliances with everyone else.
And it is perfectly honest. </p><p>

If you are going about it right, then, the process of getting tenure
is basically the same process as building a community for yourself by
networking and organizing activities.  You should be able to explain
clearly to yourself how every action you perform in your daily work
life is part of the process of getting tenure, in addition to the
more direct and immediate benefits that it provides to you and others.
As a faculty member, you will find that your life has more moving
parts than it did when you were in graduate school.  You will laugh
as you look back on all the times you complained about not having
enough time to read.  The key to managing all of your diverse
involvements as a faculty member is to make every action serve
multiple purposes.  Get assigned to committee work that helps you
with your teaching.  Do your teaching in a way that helps you get
necessary reading done.  Organize workshops that help you to write
grant proposals.  Supervise student projects in ways that fill in
pieces of your own research agenda.  Travel to meetings where you
can do several kinds of business, as well as letting you advertise
your work in the field.  Don't automatically say yes to everyone who
wants you to do work, and don't jump at every opportunity that comes
along.  Get used to the idea that your networking and organizing
activities will cause numerous opportunities to arise, and get used
to the feeling of calmly declining opportunities that don't fit with
your long-haul plan.  This may all sound self-serving, but it's not.
If you define your intellectual agenda in an expansive way then lots
of people -- students, colleagues, other people in the field -- will
be happy to work with you in ways that directly benefit your career.
Once you do establish this positive pattern, you will be able to work
with everyone on the basis of mutual benefit. </p><p>

<strong> Departmental politics </strong> </p><p>

In giving you all of this positive-sounding advice, I do not mean
to imply that the tenure process is entirely apolitical.  Nothing
that involves human beings is apolitical, for the simple reason
that politics is the practical art by which people get along.  So,
for example, remember to consult with your colleagues on everything
you do.  I have already introduced this concept of consultation
back in Section 3, in the context of how to organize a workshop.
The principle generalizes, and much of your time as a junior faculty
member will be spent consulting with people whose plans may be
affected by your plans. </p><p>

Let us consider a commonplace example.  You decide that you are going
to be a hero by organizing a seminar series.  You do a lot of work
to invite speakers, publicize their talks, show them around campus,
introduce them to people in your department, tell them about all of
the excellent research that you and your colleagues are doing, and so
on.  From your perpective, you are helping the department by bringing
in all of these first-rate people.  But other people do not share
your understanding.  They are not aware of your plans or the reasons
behind them.  What they see is not a good citizen helping everyone
to be better networked in the field.  What they see, instead, is an
endless, random series of requests for money, room bookings, claims
on people's calendars, logistical details, A/V equipment, and so
on.  They will try to explain this randomness as best they can, most
likely by imagining you to be a selfish taker.  Instead of being a
hero, you have become a goat. </p><p>

What happened?  The answer is that you did not consult.  At the very
beginning of the process you should have made a list of the people who
were affected by your plans, and then you should have run your plans
past each of them individually.  Get their ideas, concerns, relevant
information, good and bad precedents from the time before you arrived,
and so on.  At a minimum these conversations will cause others to be
informed about your plans.  More likely you will also find your plans
changing as your colleagues raise good points that you hadn't thought
of or heard about.  You may even find that your plan is a bad idea,
or that someone else is already doing something closely related to
it.  By consulting with people, you will get more career benefit from
the activity than you would have simply by organizing it on your own.
Furthermore, nearly all of the potential downsides of the activity
will go away. </p><p>

The principle of consultation generalizes much more widely.
For example, you should never raise an issue at a faculty meeting,
much less bring a major conference to your campus, without having
consulted about it beforehand.  With whom?  With the people who
are most affected by it, and with the people whose central location
in social networks will enable them to anticipate responses you will
get and what buttons you should avoid pushing.  You should not think
of consultation as a kind of arbitrary homework, or as an obstacle
you are required to jump before you can get the things you want.
Consultation is itself the most direct way to get what you want, and
its relationship-building benefits are often more important than the
benefits of the activities you are trying to organize.  It is one more
way that you are knitting yourself into the community. </p><p>

In my opinion, consultation and articulating commonalities are
the only two principles you need to participate effectively in the
politics of your department.  Consult and articulate commonalities
with everyone in your department and you will be fine.  It will be
helpful, though, if you understand some of the pathological patterns
that people get into.  One of these is mistakenly called "loyalty".
It is quite strange.  The faculty in a department are basically stuck
together on an island.  Most of them have tenure, and relatively
few of them will ever change jobs.  So they have to get along.  The
right way to get along, as you know by now, is to work continually
at articulating commonalities.  But some people don't know how to
do this, or else they choose to invest their effort in other things.
So instead they create a kind of false solidarity.  Let us say that
one faculty member holds a strong opinion that a certain technology
is ineffective.  The other members of the department may not care
very much about the matter, and so for the sake of "loyalty" they
will adopt that strong opinion as well.  Through this process,
the department will evolve a peculiar belief system that consists
of the idiosyncratic beliefs of its members.  The effect will
be especially striking when a new senior faculty member is hired:
everyone will adopt a strange new opinion overnight, corresponding to
the idiosyncracies of their new colleague.  Please do not join in to
such dynamics.  Just articulate commonalities with everyone involved.
Say "we" and "us" when you explain those commonalities to others,
and perhaps your colleagues will develop more constructive ways of
signaling their solidarity to one another. </p><p>

Enough about departmental politics -- what about campus politics?
If you want to get tenure at your university, doesn't it make sense
to cultivate a widespread network in other departments, and especially
among senior administrators?  Probably not.  The process of getting
deep tenure might lead you to network with people who happen to reside
in other departments on your campus.  Certainly those people might
be easier to reach, face-to-face anyway, other things being equal,
than people who live on different continents.  But if people in other
departments don't fit into your campaign for deep tenure then, almost
by definition, you have little reason to contact them.  The same
thing goes doubly for senior administrators.  If you are involved in
university governance activities then you will probably want to choose
specific governance issues that concern you, network around them,
identify emerging themes that pertain to governance of the university,
organize activities around those themes, and so on.  Those activities
certainly will bring you into contact with senior administrators.  If
you really want to be involved in university governance before you get
tenure, go ahead.  But most people wait until after they get tenure,
for obvious reasons. </p><p>

If you do want to build intellectual networks around campus, here is
a very straightforward way to do it: organize panel discussions.  The
process should make perfect sense to you by now.  First, find a few
people in other departments whose work relates to yours in some way.
You can identify those people by asking your colleagues.  Articulate
commonalities.  Choose one of those commonalities to be the topic
of a panel discussion.  Consult with everyone involved about both
the theme and the logistical details such as time and place.  Sign
up a half-dozen speakers including yourself, three per panel plus a
discussant.  Consult about who the best discussants might be.  Confirm
everyone's participation.  Prepare a neat, legible, plain-text e-mail
announcement.  Put a phrase like "please forward this to everyone
who might be interested" at the top.  Send the announcement to your
department's general-interest mailing list.  Ask the other speakers to
do the same.  Rehearse the daylights out of a simple, low-key fifteen
minute presentation of your work.  None of this is hard, and yet most
campuses have a shortage of people who are willing to do it.  It's
probably not crucial to your tenure case, though. </p><p>

</p><h3> <strong> <a name="section9">SECTION 9.  Your Career</a>
</strong> </h3> <p>

Once you get your dissertation finished and start on a tenure-track
job, you probably have forty years ahead of you before retirement,
maybe less if you've had an earlier career.  That might seem like
a long time.  But plenty of people get themselves stuck in negative
career patterns that prevent them from making good use of the time.
This section sketches several theories of your career.  I didn't
invent any of these theories; I have heard them all repeated many
times, in many forms, to where I am not certain who invented them.
I don't necessarily endorse them, but they are all useful in some
cases.  (If you begin your research career late in life then you will
have to adjust each theory accordingly.)  At the end of this section,
I will present my own theory of your career, which I call iterative
alignment. </p><p>

<strong> Types of creativity </strong> </p><p>

Creative people, it is said, go through a characteristic trajectory.
When they are young, their work reflects an intense, labor-intensive
type of energy.  They do not have much accumulated knowledge to build
on, so their work expresses pure genius instead.  Later in life,
though, they change gears.  They have built up a great deal of
momentum, and they use it for larger, longer-term projects. </p><p>

<strong> The structural theory </strong> </p><p>

When you are young, you are located on the periphery of the research
community.  As you go along, however, you build a community around
yourself.  As the previous generation retires, you find yourself at
the center.  This gives you an ability to set agendas that you didn't
have when you were more peripheral.  Of course, if you have a fixed
belief that you are peripheral then you will probably never acquire
that ability.  But if your beliefs are positive and you act on them,
then you have a better chance. </p><p>

<strong> The constraint theory </strong> </p><p>

This theory is concerned with ratios of risk and reward.  When you are
a junior faculty member, it says, you should follow fashion, choosing
topics whose importance is already well-understood.  That way you
will get the maximum reward with the minimum risk.  When you are in
the middle of your career, you should build new institutions, thereby
legitimizing the research fashions that the next generation of junior
faculty can follow.  Instead of catching a wave, you are making waves.
And when you are toward the end of your career, you should work on
blue-sky topics that will eventually coalesce into new institutions
through the work of the mid-career faculty behind you.  That is the
theory, anyway. </p><p>

<strong> Formulas for a research program </strong> </p><p>

Study how various successful researchers evolve their research
programs.  You will notice patterns.  One such pattern pertains to
famous researchers' relationships to their advisors.  Often an advisor
will write an important paper that sketches a new research area
in a programmatic way, without developing the full-blown theoretical
machinery that is required to generate a large number of results.
One of that person's students, however, will perceive the significance
of the new idea, and will draw together all of the literature and
social networks required to generate the results, thus leading to
large numbers of well-cited papers and a successful career. </p><p>

<strong> The university's theory </strong> </p><p>

The university as in institution is fueled by the peer review
process.  You are always being reviewed, and you are always reviewing
others in turn.  From the university's way of thinking, junior faculty
members should be relieved of most reviewing duties.  They will
probably be drafted to referee journal papers and the like, but it is
only after you receive tenure that the most onerous reviewing duties
begin.  The higher you ascend in the promotion ladder, the more likely
you are to end up on committees to review tenure candidates, research
programs, teaching programs, and whole departments, laboratories,
and universities.  Many senior faculty members complain about these
burdens, and you should avoid this complaint by actively volunteering
yourself for the duties that most interest you.  That way you can
decline the others. </p><p>

<strong> The senior faculty's theory </strong> </p><p>

When you are a new faculty member, senior faculty members often
perceive you as raw material for their institution-building
activities.  You will find yourself being recruited into one activity
or another.  I have already advised you not to be recruited into
anyone else's agenda; go ahead and participate in workshops and other
activities if they help you build relationships, but confine your
political clique-joining to articulating commonalities with everyone.
</p><p>

In mid-career, senior people will evaluate you in terms of your
leadership qualities instead of their own narrow agendas.  So it's a
good idea that you didn't join any cliques but organized new research
communities instead.  The strongest leaders will also be those with
the broadest, most capacious intellectual reach, and it is toward
the end of your mid-career phase when this breadth will be tested.
</p><p>

Finally, senior people evaluate one another based on their ability to
network beyond their own field.  It is one thing for a biologist, for
example, to network among other biologists.  But to have a real effect
on the largest institutions (the university, the funding agencies, the
corporate world, the public sphere, and so on), a biologist also needs
to network with humanists, artists, engineers, social scientists,
and administrators of many sorts.  And networking, once again, means
choosing people strategically, articulating commonalities with them,
articulating emerging themes, organizing events, and so on. </p><p>

<strong> Iterative alignment </strong> </p><p>

The theories of your career that I have described so far are useful
enough.  In my experience, however, a more useful theory is the one
that I call iterative alignment.  To understand it, suppose that you
are someone who feels that your current position in the institutions
of research doesn't fit with your own intellectual agenda -- "my work
isn't welcome", you hear yourself say.  Perhaps you are a graduate
student whose department's faculty don't care about your research
topic.  Perhaps you are a new faculty member whose colleagues don't
care about your research topic.  Perhaps you are a mid-career faculty
member in a field whose senior members don't care about your research
topic.  In each case, the problem is a misalignment between you and
the institution.  You haven't yet had the opportunity to choose your
colleagues and build the institutions that you need to realize fully
the potential of your work.  Many people overgeneralize from this
situation.  They say, "it's all about connections, and the insiders
have the whole situation rigged to their advantage".  This kind
of overgeneralization is a big mistake.  It wrongly pretends that
a temporary situation is permanent, and in so doing it tends to
<i>make</i> the situation permanent. </p><p>

How do you fix a problem of misalignment?  By this point, it
will not surprise you to hear that the solution lies in networking.
One purpose of networking, so far as your career is concerned, is
to manufacture a closer alignment between you and the institutions
around you.  If you are a student whose faculty don't care about your
research, then indeed you will have to meet them halfway for a while.
If you are a junior faculty member in a department where they don't
know or care about half of the twenty people in your field who
ought to be writing letters for you, make a list of thirty people
that includes both your twenty and theirs.  In the meantime, build
networks.  Get lots of interviews and lots of good job offers.
Then get a job that is better aligned with your research interests.
Notice that it is a two-way street: the process of alignment
doesn't just mean forcing the world to fit with your pre-existing
research interests.  Rather, the process of dialogue, articulating
commonalities, and internalizing the ideas of others will
change your research agenda, and your networking, organizing, and
institution-building activities will help create an institutional
niche within which you can be supported in conducting research within
that agenda.  By iterative alignment, I mean that each step forward
in your career improves the alignment by an incremental degree.  One
step might get you more sympathetic colleagues.  Another might create
a journal for you to publish your research in.  Another might ensure
a flow of research funding.  Another might build a widespread network
of researchers who consider you a leader in their overall movement.
And so on.  Each increment of alignment, though, happens in the same
basic way: networking, articulation of commonalities and emerging
themes, and organizing of activities.  That is the basic cycle. </p><p>

A common misunderstanding is that iterative alignment, or the research
community generally, requires you to give up your dreams, conforming
to someone else's agenda in order to get along.  That is not true.
Iterative alignment is a two-way street, that is true.  You will
change, even as you build and rebuild the institution to fit with
yourself.  But the fact that you are changing does not itself imply
that you are conforming to some alien agenda.  If you are doing it
right then you are changing simply because you are growing, having
better and better ideas, and realizing more and more of your potential.
This is a critically important intuition: every time you spontaneously
notice an emerging theme -- that is, every time that you go through
the cycle of reading people's research, networking with them,
articulating commonalities with them, and noticing a theme emerging
from all of those conversations -- you are also noticing an aspect of
yourself.  Someone else who went through the same cycle would probably
notice something different -- not because the situation is arbitrary,
but because the situation is filled with potentially valuable research
directions.  When you notice an emerging theme and then organize
activities around it, you are knitting yourself into the community.
This process of knitting is what iterative alignment is all about.
You align yourself and the institution by iteratively, incrementally
knitting yourself into it.  You should do work that is aligned with
who you really are.  Why?  Because that way you are more likely to
notice the entrepreneurial opportunity that the institutions are
presenting to you.  If you simply conformed to some arbitrary agenda,
then you wouldn't have the same intuitive grasp of the ideas.  You
would probably get stuck in a low orbit that corresponds to the first,
least aligned setting in which you happened to have a job.  In this
sense, the institutions of research are calling forth a certain honesty
from you, and you need to have the courage to approach the cycle of
iterative alignment in that spirit. </p><p>

The theory of iterative alignment generalizes everything that I have
said already in this article.  In producing your dissertation, for
example, I argued that you were really producing yourself as a member
of the research community.  That is an example of iterative alignment:
aligning yourself with others by knitting your research topic into
the existing literature and the people who wrote it.  Articulating an
emerging theme and organizing a workshop around it is also an example
of iterative alignment.  And so is the process of getting deep
tenure with your research community.  In each case you are choosing
carefully the people you want to associate with, and you are using
language creatively to articulate commonalities with those people
and internalize their ideas.  Iterative alignment, then, is a cycle
whose details vary depending on where exactly you are located in
the institutions at a given moment.  And when you achieve perfect
alignment, there's a sense in which your career is complete.  You
have knitted yourself fully into the institutions and communities
around you.  Your personal agendas align perfectly with the agendas
that have been institutionalized for the benefit of others.  Your
own innovations and accomplishments have been fully incorporated
into those others' work.  The good you've done is now distributed
throughout the people who have come after you.  And you can now
retire, knowing that you have made your fullest possible contribution
to the field. </p><p>

</p><h3> <strong> <a name="section10">SECTION 10.  Understanding the
Research World</a> </strong> </h3> <p>

I want to assume now that you have built a network, internalized
most of the lessons that I have outlined above, and generally
gotten yourself established in your field, and that you now want
to understand the dynamics of the research world in a deeper way.
Everybody that you work with has been building their own network in
more or less the same way that you have been, and the institutions of
research create tremendous incentives for everyone to keep on doing
so.  Beyond that, however, the institutions create new incentives
for people who have reached the plateau that you have -- providing
yourself with a functioning network -- and who want to move on to
higher levels of accomplishment in their field.  To understand these
higher-level career strategies and their implications, another round
of basic concepts will be required.  This section lays out these
concepts seriatim, and the next section agonizes over their moral
consequences. </p><p>

I should warn you that some of these concepts concern the more
dysfunctional aspects of research institutions.  My purpose in
explaining these concepts is not to demoralize you, but quite the
contrary to help you notice them, avoid them, if necessary defend
or even cure yourself from them, and ultimately adopt a bemused
distance from them as you go about the daily work of positive
community-building. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="invisible"> (1) The invisible college </a>
</strong> </p><p>

When most people look at the university, they see a physical campus
with buildings and people.  Even if they went to college themselves,
they probably have little understanding of the institutions of
research.  Accordingly, as you are socialized into those institutions
yourself, you will probably acquire a different awareness of them.
You will develop a professional network that includes researchers
at several universities, and you will learn about the people and
activities at those other universities.  As a result, you will
acquire a mental map of numerous universities and their associated
orientations, reputations, and histories.  This map will be very real
to you, and you will probably know more about your counterparts in a
university on another continent than you know about the people in the
building next door to you.  The interconnected global research network
is largely invisible to outsiders, and for that reason it is called
the "invisible college", a term that derives from Diana Crane's book
"Invisible Colleges: Diffusion of Knowledge in Scientific Communities"
(University of Chicago Press, 1972). </p><p>

The concept of an invisible college is useful for several reasons.
First of all, it helps to explain some of the institutional tensions
that universities face: individual researchers generally identify
more strongly with their invisible college than they do with the
organization that employs them.  After all, it is principally the
invisible college that evaluates the researcher's work by writing
letters and refereeing articles.  Universities are always threatening
to be pulled apart by these centrifugal forces.  Industrial labs,
likewise, often have trouble persuading researchers to focus on the
issues that affect customers, because the researcher's long-term
career success depends on staying current with research agendas in
the invisible college. </p><p>

Invisible colleges also help explain the emerging uses of technology
in research.  "Collaboratories", for example, are on-line research
community environments that cause invisible colleges to become, so to
speak, more real.  Most invisible colleges already have conferences,
journals, and the like.  They may even have Web sites and mailing
lists.  In each case the pressure is toward ever-greater integration
of the different research groups within an invisible college.  As the
collaboratories become more technically feasible, these pressures will
become even more intense.  Ongoing real-time collaborations between
researchers at different sites will become more common, and seminars
might even be held at several sites simultaneously over video links.
The details will depend on the needs and finances of each field, of
course, but the general direction of the pressure toward integration
will be largely the same.  It is worth wondering, then, whether too
much integration can be a bad thing.  It is useful for each university
to have its own distinctive approach to a field.  Diversity is good,
and the institution only supports diversity if a new approaches can
colonize a small number of universities without excessive pressures
to be interlocked with their opposite numbers at other universities.
This may be an important issue in the future. </p><p>

Finally, the concept of an invisible college helps keep you human.
You can become so immersed in your own particular invisible college
that you become oblivious to your environment -- the neighborhood
where you work.  Think, for example, about the other universities
in your region.  Are they on your map at all?  Do you feel bad about
that? </p><p>

<strong> <a name="networked"> (2) Networked individualism </a>
</strong> </p><p>

Let us take the concept of an invisible college a step further.
Imagine a vast diagram of all the professional networks in the world
of research.  In this diagram, everyone will be connected to everyone
they know.  Abstract as it sounds, such a diagram can actually be
drawn with reasonable accuracy by following the citations in the
researchers' published work.  The analysis of these citation links
is called "bibliometrics", and is a scholarly industry in itself.
Throughout this article, I have been painting a picture of the
structure of these relationships.  When two researchers have become
members of one another's professional networks, they maintain a sort
of surveillance of one another.  They read one another's work, monitor
one another's career progress, hear reports on one another through
common acquaintances, update one another in periodic conversations
at conferences, and so on.  Their relationship has an architecture
-- a structure and logic that are dictated largely by the workings
of research as an institution. </p><p>

On one level, the architecture of relationships in the research world
has not changed much since the Renaissance.  Scholars have always
read each other's work, corresponded, traveled to visit one another,
cooperated and competed, and so on.  So what has been changing in
the world of the Internet, not to mention cellular telephones, cheap
air travel, and other technological advances?  Those new technologies
do not change anything on their own, but they do provide tools that
people use to do more of the things that they already want to do.  The
institutions of research create tremendous incentives to keep in touch
with the other members of your professional network, and that's what's
happened: people are in much denser and more continuous contact with
their professional contacts than ever before.  It is only a slight
exaggeration to say that we're heading toward a world in which
everyone is a constant presence for everyone else.  Technologies that
are currently under development will propel this trend even further.
Digital libraries, for example, will allow everyone to monitor
everyone else's publications in real time, and cheap, high-quality
video links will make it possible to organize seminars at a distance.
While they will not eliminate face-to-face interaction altogether,
these technologies will allow researchers to maintain even more
continual contact than they do today. </p><p>

This development is striking, and it counts as a new chapter in
the history of the human person.  Barry Wellman calls it "networked
individualism".  Networked individuals (such as yourself) are like
air traffic controllers who, by using a video display and audio
communications, constantly maintain a mental map of all the planes
in their airspace.  This effect can be quite tangible when you are
reading your daily e-mail, and it can be especially tangible when
you are working on a large-scale professional project, like organizing
a conference, that requires you to keep track of the status of dozens
or hundreds of individuals, or to reach out selectively into the space
of individuals in your field to identify the best speakers, authors,
referees, or meeting participants for a given purpose.  As the world
becomes networked, you will have to decide consciously how to manage
the blizzard of communications that your network will entail. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="expanding"> (3) The expanding universe </a>
</strong> </p><p>

So far I've been making it sound as though all networks are equally
good.  Start with what you care about, get some research going, and
build a professional community for yourself around that research
topic.  And that is still my advice.  Nonetheless, the problem
of building a network takes on another dimension when you adopt
a longer-term view.  If you are entering the research community at
the usual age, just out of college or a few years afterward, then
you have a whole career ahead of you.  To really prosper, and to
really be part of something exciting, you want to join a field that
is growing -- what I call an "expanding universe".  A field that
is shrinking is generally an unhappy place to be; at best it spends
its time negotiating mergers and acquisitions with other shrinking
fields, hoping to maintain the critical mass that is necessary to be
a viable political force.  People find themselves fighting over fewer
resources, and they have a much harder time attracting new blood.  A
growing field, by contrast, easily attracts new people.  And resources
are multiplying, so people don't need to fight one another.  Instead
they can join together in the collective enterprise of laying claim to
the new territory that is opening up. </p><p>

Smart students have a powerful instinct for expanding universes, and
often spot them before the famous people do.  How the smart students
work this trick is one of the deeper mysteries of the professional
world: after all, they are just students, and thus lack the extensive
networks that are normally required to see big patterns.  Part of
the answer is simply that they are young.  The way that ideas change
is that the people who believed the old ideas die (Planck said this),
and in that sense intellectual trends are driven by the interests of
the young.  This is one reason why it is okay for you to pursue the
research that you personally find exciting: despite all of your unique
individuality, you are also a product of a place and time, and even
before you start networking you can be confident that plenty of other
people will develop research interests that are more or less on the
same wavelength as yours.  You will network with those people, and
when the old people die you and your cohort will inherit the world.
At the same time, you can frame your topic in a lot of different ways,
and it's helpful to frame your topic in a way that other people can
relate to.  That is part of what I mean by "articulating an emerging
theme".  In trying to articulate the theme that unifies the research
of your peers, and that puts a name on what they find exciting about
their research, you will be intuiting -- indeed, creating -- the
expanding universe of your generation of researchers. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="positive"> (4) Positive feedback </a> </strong> </p><p>

You are probably familiar with the general idea.  Negative feedback is
when forces operate to keep a system in equilibrium, pushing it back
toward its nominal value whenever it drifts away.  Positive feedback,
by contrast, amplifies small disturbances so that they feed upon
themselves and become ever greater.  Complex real-world situations
generally combine kinds of feedback, but it is useful to consider
some of the positive feedbacks that promote successful careers.  Let
us say that you happen to mention topic X in a speech, and a reporter
calls you to comment on it.  You may not be an absolute authority on
X, but if you are the first person to be quoted on X then you need to
start studying.  Why?  Because reporters often decide who to call for
quotes by looking in Nexis and seeing who has been quoted in earlier
articles.  Having been the first to be quoted, you will also be the
second, third, and fourth.  Soon you will be closely identified with
the issue; nobody else will have a chance.  The same thing can happen
in many other contexts, including speaking engagements, consulting
jobs, referrals, and (to a lesser degree) citations.  (Of course, once
your position has become entrenched in this way, it's not positive
feedback any more.  Now it's negative feedback, as institutional
forces operate to reinforce the status quo in your favor.) </p><p>

Another type of positive feedback is learning: if you learn about
an activity (such as a certain experimental procedure), then you are
more likely to get further chances to engage in the activity, thereby
learning some more, so that you eventually become a leading expert.
Yet another type is networking: if everyone knows that you have a
big professional network, then they are more likely to want to meet
you, thus expanding your network.  People often stumble into careers
because these types of positive feedback get started by accident,
and good career strategies always encourage positive feedback.
Pick an emerging issue and stake it out as your own: become publicly
identified with it, learn the details of it from practical experience,
and build professional networks around it.  If you pick a good issue
then the universe around it will expand, and your career will expand
along with it.  Picking an emerging issue is like placing a bet; your
own intellectual intuition is the best guide to the best issue, but
internalizing the views of others through networking is a good way to
deepen your intuition. </p><p>

Positive feedback also applies to departments, universities, and
industrial labs.  People want to work with the best people in their
field, and so whichever organization first gets a critical mass of
strong people can hire the best, thus locking in its position over
the long term.  This fact helps explain the hiring strategies of
deans.  As a general matter, it is in the dean's interest to build
specific areas of strength that correspond to expanding disciplinary
universes.  That is, the dean's job is to build a group of researchers
in a field whose prominence and resource base is likely to grow in the
coming years.  Choosing a research area that represents an expanding
universe is obviously a good strategy, because an investment in that
area will pay off as the field becomes more prominent.  But it is a
good strategy for another reason, which is that existing, established
research areas have already become dominated by other organizations.
Those organizations benefit from positive feedback, and so it is
little use to compete with them.  Instead, the dean seeks to get
positive feedback working from scratch in a new area. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="arbitrage"> (5) Arbitrage </a> </strong> </p><p>

Arbitrage is a concept from finance.  An arbitrageur monitors two or
more markets, looking for gaps in prices.  If apples are selling for
$1 uptown and $2 downtown, the arbitrageur will swoop in, buy some
apples uptown, and sell them downtown.  The resulting profit will
depend on communication and transportation technologies, and the
magnitude of the price gaps that open up in practice will be limited
by the number of competing arbitrageurs.  Fully arbitraged markets
have uniform prices.  To remain profitable, therefore, an arbitrageur
must innovate technologically or search for markets that are not yet
well arbitraged. </p><p>

Something similar happens in the research world.  A researcher might
notice that a concept that is well-developed in one field can be
applied to problems of wide interest in another field.  If the concept
is still unknown in that other field, then an arbitrage opportunity
exists.  This is how management consultants work: they work with
one company, learning that company's organizational and technological
skills, and then they sell their enhanced skills to other companies.
It is also the way that many careers are made in research: either
by shifting a steady stream of concepts from field A to field B,
or by taking a particular concept from field A and looking for many
different fields where it can be applied, or by moving from one field
to another, picking up concepts in each and then looking for another
field where they can be applied.  These are entirely honorable ways to
make a living, and they provide the intellectual cross-fertilization
that keeps fields healthy. </p><p>

The position of the arbitrageur can be understood in terms of social
networks.  In some cases an arbitrageur can learn new concepts, or
contribute to new fields, simply by reading books.  More commonly,
however, the arbitrageur builds a network in each field, consisting
of those researchers whose work is relevant to the arbitrageur's own
interests in that particular field.  Of course, the very idea that
the arbitrageur builds two different networks is somewhat artificial:
the whole research world is one single network that is more highly
connected in some regions than in others.  "Fields" can be identified
by their ideas and methods, but they also correspond to regions of
high interconnectivity in the sprawling network of the whole research
world.  Arbitrageurs are effectively taking advantage of regions where
the networks are relatively thin, importing and exporting useful goods
(ideas, concepts, methods, tools) based on a strong understanding of
supply on one side and demand on the other. </p><p>

The opportunities for arbitrage are one reason why I have encouraged
you to ignore disciplinary boundaries as you build your professional
network.  By looking for professional friends who are related to your
research interests in several different ways, I suggested, you would
create a network that looks like spokes in a wheel, of which you
are the hub. If some of these people have nothing in common with one
another then that's a good thing.  It means that you will be able
to establish a "trading zone" through which good ideas can transfer
between fields that are not otherwise connected.  By spanning several
research communities, you will have more intellectual resources and
career options than if you simply tried to join an existing group. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="disciplinary"> (6) Disciplinary narratives </a>
</strong> </p><p>

As a scholar, you are certainly aware of your responsibility to cite
relevant work by other people, especially when your own work builds on
it.  Your papers, like most people's, probably contain sections that
are largely devoted to citing past work, and you probably distribute
citations through the rest of your paper as well.  This is good; it
is part of the process of knitting yourself and your work into the web
of relationships in your community.  But you can also look at these
citations another way: as a narrative of the history of the field.
These narratives may not be great literature, but they are narratives
nonetheless.  They have characters, events, and a chronological
story line.  They recount the creation myths of the field, its
stages of development, its conflicts, its heroes and villains, and
so on.  The narratives in your paper will be shaped by your reading
and relationships, but they will also be influenced by the narratives
that you have heard or read from others.  It is fairly unusual, for
example, for a scholar to come along and tell the history of a field
in completely different terms, recognizing different founders or
different heroes, or giving a central place to different innovations
and departures than the ones that normally form the backbone of the
field's narratives of itself. </p><p>

Where do these narratives come from?  At one level, everyone fashions
their own narrative, connecting the dots among the various prominent
works that relate to their own.  Having laboriously rehearsed their
personal version of the field's narrative in their dissertations,
they keep it up to date as their own work evolves, and as new work
appears.  At another level, however, the narratives are constructed
collectively.  People who do related work will probably have related
narratives, and people who work in the same field will probably derive
much of the outline of their narrative from whoever founded it.  When
someone founds a field, they are usually very concerned to give the
field a proper history.  This might involve identifying precursors,
marking out the differences between the new field and older fields,
making clear which work the new field defines itself against, and
so on.  Later on, other people in the field will be sure to cite the
people who have most influenced them.  Peer pressure will grow to cite
particular works that are thought especially important. </p><p>

Over time, a more or less conventional narrative will take form.  This
conventional narrative is not a simple thing.  It may settle disputes
over who should get credit for a given innovation.  It may embody a
collective judgement that certain works represented side branches or
cul-de-sacs, and that certain other works represented the main line
of development.  Ideas from certain works will become part of the
routinized story that people tell about their field, and those works
will be heavily cited accordingly.  Or a work may introduce an idea
that seems revolutionary at first but then starts to seem so obvious
that people forget that it needs to be cited any more.  Some authors
may make a special point of insisting that their work be cited, where
other authors may not care as much, or may not be around to check up.
In short, the conventional narrative emerges as a sort of collective
negotiation among the field's members.  And as new scholars encounter
the conventional narrative in their readings and lectures, it settles
into place and becomes practically irreversible. </p><p>

I mention these disciplinary narratives for several reasons.  First
of all, I don't want you to be imprisoned by them.  Look at them
<i>as</i> narratives, as stories that are told according to certain
conventions, and that could have been told differently.  See their
political character -- not necessarily as a sign of bad faith, simply
as a sign of their having been created by human beings through their
dealings with one another.  As you read the literature, consider
whether the conventional narrative of your discipline should be
rewritten.  Declare independence by quietly citing works that have
been unjustly neglected by others (such as works by people who
haven't done their networking).  Ask yourself if the field's founder
constructed a creation myth that exaggerates its differences from what
came before, or that emphasized a single moment of invention when in
fact (as often happens) the basic ideas emerged in several places more
or less at once.  Maybe you want to rewrite the narrative a little bit
in your next paper.  And think about how your own work deserves to fit
into the narrative.  Describe your work accordingly in your papers,
and do make sure that the people who should be citing you feel a bit
of peer pressure.  You don't have to be a jerk about it, but you don't
have to get trampled either. </p><p>

There is an aspect of disciplinary narratives that I want to emphasize
in particular.  When your field was originally founded, the founders
probably overcame opposition from an existing establishment.  As a
result, the rhetoric that they developed and taught to their students
was probably preoccupied with that particular fight.  For example,
artificial intelligence (in which I was trained, and whose story
I will tell in more detail in a moment) began as a counterrevolution
against behaviorism in psychology.  Because of this the rhetoric of AI
is saturated with turns of phrase that are designed to do two things:
(1) set up a cleanly defined opposition between AI and behaviorism,
and (2) portray AI as right and behaviorism as wrong.  The AI people
won their fight with behaviorism, which hardly exists any more.  And
yet the fight goes on.  The rhetoric of the field is still aimed at
defeating behaviorism, and this causes AI people to interpret nearly
any criticism as a resurgence of behaviorism, even when it clearly
is not.  It also causes dissidents within the field to reinvent
behaviorism under one guise or another, simply because that is what's
thinkable within the vocabulary of the field. </p><p>

This is the sad irony: even though AI won its fight with behaviorism,
it did so by making itself much more similar to behaviorism than it
should have.  The problem is not so much with goal (2), portraying
AI as right and behaviorism as wrong, as with goal (1), setting up a
cleanly defined opposition between AI and behaviorism.  In order to
set up this clean opposition, it was necessary for the AI founders to
commit themselves to many of behaviorism's foundational assumptions,
such as the idea that cognition takes the form of an input (stimulus)
which causes something-or-other (a blank zone for the behaviorists,
a cognitive process for the AI people), which then causes an output
(response).  This framework has not served AI especially well, for
example because it distracts attention from the ways in which people
and robots engage in complex activities that are embedded in complex
environments.  Yet this complaint is hard to express in the language
of AI, whose organizing question is still, "is this behaviorism, and
if not then what's the problem?".  You can accomplish a great deal
by spotting this sort of out-of-date controversy and deciding not to
participate in it.  Even in cases where the "enemy" establishment is
still very much in force, you will accomplish much more by honestly
digging into the strengths and weaknesses of the two polarized sides,
looking for a synthesis rather than a fight, than you will by joining
someone else's ancient struggle. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="advisors"> (7) Advisors' incentives to stifle
creativity </a> </strong> </p><p>

The next concept that you need is not so fun.  This is the incentive
that thesis advisors have to stifle the creativity of their students.
It's an insidious phenomenon, and it is not entirely the advisors'
fault.  Here is how it works.   Your advisor will organize seminars,
or otherwise recommend reading, and the reading lists that result will
derive from the advisor's own voice -- from an intellectual map of
the world that reflects the advisor's own effort to define a research
program and situate it within an existing network of professional
relationships.  If you confine your reading to your thesis advisor's
recommendations -- or, even worse, if you feel so overwhelmed with
work that you accept your advisor's interpretations of those readings
rather than engaging with them afresh yourself -- then your thinking
will be organized and bounded by your advisor's thinking.  You will
talk the way your advisor talks, cite the same work, address the same
audience, and so on.  Of course, this needn't be a disaster.  If you
are smart, and if your advisor has chosen an expanding disciplinary
universe, then you will write a good dissertation within that
universe.  You will get a good job, and you will take your place
in a hierarchy.  When the people in your advisor's cohort finally
retire, then you will be in charge.  It is not such a bad life.  But
it is not the life that you were meant to live -- the life that you
would create for yourself if you complemented your advisor's teaching
with some autonomous learning of your own, driven by your own sense
of intellectual excitement and your own intuition for the expanding
universe that is taking form on completely different ground from your
advisor's. </p><p>

So is your advisor deliberately brainwashing you in order to build
an empire of clones and acolytes?  Perhaps.  Some advisors do this
consciously, I am sad to say.  It's their way of proving to themselves
(and, they think, to others) that they are a success.  After all, they
are evaluated on their "impact" in their fields, and one way to create
the illusion of impact is to program your students so that they are
forever citing your work.  Perhaps they just want to make sure that
they do not die forgotten.  Or perhaps they simply get locked into
a fixed idea about your thesis topic and try to "help" you graduate
on time by keeping you narrowly focused on that topic.  Of course they
rationalize it in various ways.  But with other advisors it happens
inadvertently.  Your advisor is not God, cannot read everything, and
inevitably sees the world in particular ways.  Your advisor lives in
a world that seems very big, and if your field is expanding then you
could perfectly well construct a world within that world that itself
seems very big.  The alternative is not to renounce your advisor, but
simply to reach out and take a broader view. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="turf"> (8) Turf </a> </strong> </p><p>

I spoke of a growing field as an "expanding universe", but what
exactly does it mean to say that a field is growing?  Of course, on
one level a field grows when more people join it.  But that doesn't
explain much.  Nor does it explain much to say that a field grows when
more money becomes available to fund its research, though money is
surely not a trivial matter.  At a more fundamental level, the size of
a field is determined by the turf that it has staked out.  My choice
of the word "turf" is a little misleading, in that actual literal
turf -- geographic territory with grass on it -- exists in a fixed
quantity, so that the phrase "turf war" connotes a bloody, petty,
zero-sum game.  But that's not what I mean here.  In the research
community, turf arises when an intellectual leader defines a research
agenda -- that is, provides a rhetoric for articulating research
topics, arguing their importance, and defending their legitimacy.
Having been made researchable, those topics can now be turned into
refereed journal papers, and thus into grant proposals, promotions,
and careers. </p><p>

Here are some examples.  When Herbert Simon and his cohorts founded
artificial intelligence in the 1950s, they created turf.  In fact
they created a huge amount of turf, since the general formula of
using computational structures in analyzing human mental life can be
applied in thousands of ways.  Just pick a phenomenon of human mental
life (remembering, planning, improvising, etc), select or devise
a computational structure that seems generally analogous to it, build
a computer program, and talk about the program in ways that make it
seem similar to what people do.  Other examples of research programs
that create turf include Richard Posner's revival in the 1970s of the
economic analysis of law (pick a legal issue and apply the language
of supply and demand to it) and Noam Chomsky's founding in the 1950s
of the modern study of syntactic analysis by means of formal language
theory. </p><p>

What's really striking about the case of Chomsky is that his actual
territory of research concerned some extremely narrow questions
about the formal relationships between certain kinds of grammatical
structures, for example when assertions ("John took a six-pack to
the party") become questions ("What did John take to the party?").
Even though these questions are tiny footnotes in the big picture of
linguistics, Chomsky nonetheless managed to found an enormous research
enterprise, one which many linguists have been brought up to regard
as nearly the whole of the field.  Chomsky was successful in founding
such a large research program for a simple reason: formal language
theory provides the intellectual tools to manufacture researchable
topics.  Accordingly, every paper in Chomskyan linguistics --
including several subfields of linguistics that broke off from
Chomsky's own projects while retaining nearly all of the intellectual
foundations that Chomsky created -- is written according to a sort of
grammar that Chomsky defined and institutionalized. </p><p>

These examples point to the actual nature of turf.  In order to do
research, and in order to publish your research, you need a research
topic.  Turf is, in part, a method of manufacturing research topics,
a formula for producing the raw material from which people make
their careers.  But turf must be defended.  On a small scale, you can
only publish your research if you can defend it to the satisfaction
of the journal's referees.  And on a large scale, a research program
depends for its funding and other resources on its reputation in
the larger research community.  It is important to distinguish here
between two kinds of legitimacy that research needs.  In a narrow
sense, the claimed results must be seen to follow from the premises.
But in a broad sense, the research topic itself must be seen as
legitimate: that is, as novel, conceptually coherent, defensible in
its working assumptions, intrinsically important, likely to lead to
practical applications, likely to lead to more productive research,
and so on.  The precise criteria will depend to some degree on
the field (engineering is evaluated differently from history), but
every field needs someone to put up a fight when the legitimacy of
the field's research topics comes into question.  And many topics
require a great deal of defending, given that the many idealized
assumptions, unmotivated choices, and unredeemed IOU's they entail.
That is what a visionary founder like Simon, Posner, or Chomsky does.
These guys don't just publish technical papers within their field
-- what Aristotle would call "esoteric" work, that is, work that is
directed to the community of like-minded researchers within the field.
They also publish "exoteric" work, that is, work written for a broad
audience that explicates the field and defends it against critics,
either explicitly, by answering the critics' charges one after
another, or implicitly, by providing the field with conceptual and
rhetorical foundations that are meant to be understood by insiders and
outsiders alike. </p><p>

These sorts of exoteric apologetics for a field's turf are one
more important way in which people become dependent on their thesis
advisors (or, indeed, on their advisors' advisors).  If you grow up
intellectually within the small world of a particular field, you will
never be called on to defend the legitimacy of your research topic.
You will probably read the founder's exoteric texts, and you will
learn to talk the field's rhetoric, but you will probably not have
occasion to really internalize the arguments of the field's opponents.
Many people reach mid-career in this position, and I believe that it
induces in them a kind of vertigo: they have staked their careers on
the continued viability of a chunk of turf that they did not create
and cannot defend, and if that turf loses its legitimacy then their
careers will evaporate.  It takes a lot of reading and networking
to establish yourself in a different research community than the
one you were trained in, and it's especially hard if your training
has not encouraged you to develop a robust intellectual life outside
the fine details of your particular lab's research program. </p><p>

This is, in my opinion, a major cause of some of the less fortunate
cultural phenomena of research world, including us-and-them
stereotyping of other research communities and a tendency to make a
virtue of narrowness or to overinflate the real scope and potential
of the field as it stands.  I believe it also explains the fury with
which many researchers respond to any criticism of the foundations of
their research enterprise.  On one level, the organizing ideology of
the turf routinely caricatures opponents as irrational, unscientific,
etc, so that critics are heard to be saying things that are literally
crazy.  After all, most people's fields seem like whole universes
to them, and their networking is often confined to people who share
the same ideology.  On another level, the researchers themselves
are unconsciously terrified that their careers will explode if the
criticism succeeds.  As a result, they are motivated to exaggerate
the extent to which the real concrete results of the research program
have established the truth of the intellectual school within which
they work.  These pathologies are not universal, of course, and they
vary greatly in their intensity.  By describing them, I want to help
you identify them and avoid falling into them.  People in the research
world are too often honored in proportion to the amount of turf they
created, and not in proportion to their intelligence and goodness.
If you can shake off this bad habit then you can start honoring the
right people, and honoring them in the right way. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="institutionalization"> (9) Institutionalization
</a> </strong> </p><p>

When you are a student, you tend to take for granted the whole
institutional framework that you are being socialized into.  You might
complain about it, and you might even spin conspiracy theories about
it, but you do not have the information that would be necessary to
understand what the institution really is and how it really works.
This article is intended as part of the solution to that problem.
Having explained how research institutions work on a micro level,
then, I want to explain where they come from.  Let's take a simple
case: a workshop.  You could start a workshop yourself; I explained
the procedure back in Section 3 under the heading of "intellectual
leadership".  If you can round up a critical mass of attendees,
then you just do it.  Your workshop meets, everyone is happy, and
the idea circulates of maybe doing it again next year.  Maybe someone
else takes the lead, hosts it in their own seminar room, and so on.
If enough people keep on feeling like the workshop is worth their
time, then maybe it takes on a life of its own.  If your emerging
theme happens to define an expanding universe, then your workshop
will grow.  Twenty people might attend the first year's meeting, forty
people the next year, a hundred the year after that, five hundred
the year after that, and so on.  At that point you probably call it a
"conference", and maybe you and the other central ringleaders organize
yourself into some sort of standing committee.  Maybe you start an
organization, a mailing list, or whatever you build consensus around.
Your emerging theme has been institutionalized. </p><p>

Notice something important: at no point did you have to ask anybody
for permission.  You just did it.  It's a free country, so you used
your freedom of association to associate with other researchers who
share your interests.  You can accomplish a great deal this way.  But
this is just the beginning of the story.  The next step comes when you
start a refereed journal.  This is something else that you just do,
although now you need to persuade a publisher that a critical mass of
interest exists to make the journal work as a business.  You start a
journal in exactly the same way that you organize a workshop: having
already built a network, organized some workshops or conferences, etc,
you circulate a draft proposal to the ten people whose names everyone
would most expect to see on the journal's board of editors, and if you
feel like the proposal has some energy behind it then you go ahead.
The people in your network will welcome the new journal because they
don't feel their papers are being refereed fairly by the existing
journals; your journal will ensure that the referees, while presumably
maintaining high standards, will at least comprehend the papers and
thus be able to judge them fairly. </p><p>

Above all, a journal gathers up and organizes a community of people
who share a complex of research problems, so that everyone can at
least anticipate that the referees will regard their problems as
legitimate, even if they do not agree with the details of the research
itself.  That is the service a journal provides to its contributors.
In this way, a journal frees its contributors to write the papers
that they really want to write, and it ensures that their vitae will
now fill up with bona fide refereed journal articles.  Of course,
the value of those vita entries will depend on the larger community's
evaluation of the quality of research in the journal, and for that
purpose it will still be necessary for the emerging field's founders
to engage in the exoteric apologetics that I explained above.  Even
so, a journal does a tremendous service to a community by enabling
its members to be the judges of one another's work. </p><p>

A journal is a step on the road to institutionalization, but it still
does not explain where resources come from.  Let us consider one type
of resource, probably the most important of all: job positions at
universities and other research organizations.  (These job positions
are often regrettably called FTE's, for "full-time equivalents", since
it is somewhat common for someone to be appointed half-time in each of
two different departments.)  Where do job positions come from?  In the
case of universities, they come proximally from deans.  When resources
become available at the overall university level, the deans engage in
politely savage warfare to lay claim to some new positions, and then
they allocate the new positions among the departments in their domain.
Meanwhile, each department tries to help the dean by describing in
compelling terms the turf that is opening up at the cutting edge of
their field.  As your research area becomes institutionalized, your
collective job is to define the emerging turf you see ahead of you, to
make the case for this turf seem compelling to your dean, and to help
your dean make the turf seem compelling to the university hierarchy.
That is where job positions come from.  The process is not always
sweetness and light, because much of it takes place in committees,
different subsets of whose participants are angling to define their
own research area as the Next Big Thing for the allocation of job
slots.  An ascendant field can find itself laying claim to literally
dozens of job slots in a period of a few years, and at each step the
field's members will be working their networks furiously to produce a
steady stream of high-quality candidates for the jobs.  Maybe this is
how you got your own job. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="routinization"> (10) Routinization of charisma </a>
</strong> </p><p>

Now that I've explained how to institutionalize the new research area
you've founded, notice something important about institutions: they
arise through individual initiative.  This fact has many consequences.
When you begin your career in research, you will encounter a landscape
of already-established institutions -- they will be called "fields",
"journals", "conferences", "agencies", and so on -- and every one of
those institutions will have arisen through exactly the same kinds of
individual initiative that I am recommending to you.  Someone built
a network, articulated an emerging theme, organized people around it,
connected the emerging constituency with a supply of resources, and
created new organizations.  Those new organizations then settled down
and took on a life of their own. </p><p>

Institutionalization thus entails a process of maturation: from the
initiative of a founder to the more anonymous settled patterns of
the long term.  Max Weber called this process "the routinization of
charisma".  The founder acts as a kind of enterpreneur, articulating
a discourse for the field and creating turf within which others
can pursue their careers.  As a result, institutions often retain
the fingerprints of their founders.  If the founder's overwhelming
imperative was to defeat an existing establishment, that imperative
will probably continue to structure the field below the surface.
If the founder's overwhelming imperative was to secure the patronage
of military funding agencies, then research problems will probably
continue to be framed in that way after the founder is gone --  even
if nobody realizes it.  If the founder was a poor organizer or had a
personal preference for a chaotic institutional style, then that style
may persist for decades afterward.  Nothing is inevitable, of course,
but institutional patterns do tend to persist once they are put in
place.  And these patterns originate with the founder, and with the
opportunities and challenges that the founder originally confronted.
</p><p>

What does the routinization of charisma mean for your own career?
Several things.  (1) Don't be fooled by the sense of permanence that
every institution projects.  Your field's founder -- and especially
the founder's students -- codified a fragmentary mess of ideas into
survey papers, syllabi, and textbooks, all of which are supposed to
look seamless.  They're not seamless, though, and you should assume
that everything is much less stable and coherent than it appears.
(2) To find the seams, you should study the history of your field.
Go back to the founding documents, and get old-timers talking on social
occasions.  Understand the context in which the field was founded, and
look for left-over patterns that are no longer relevant in the present
day.  It's alright to have respect for founders, but realize that they
are mere human beings, products of the times and places in which they
lived.  (3) When you do discover these obsolete patterns, deprogram
yourself.  You will inevitably have ingested a sprawling network of
unarticulated assumptions into your own thought patterns, and if you
can liberate your mind then you can improve your research.  (4) When
you start creating institutions yourself, be responsible.  You don't
want your personal quirks -- or your short-term opportunism, rivalries,
and greed -- to be transformed into settled canons that get taught to
generations of unsuspecting students. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="imperialism"> (11) Imperialism </a> </strong> </p><p>

In order to grow, a research community must create more turf -- that
is, broader and broader territories of legitimately researchable
topics that the community's members can publish on.  Because turf
is not a fixed quantity, it is often possible to create new turf
within the existing boundaries of the field.  In this sense, turf
is "nested", meaning that people build their careers and reputations
by mapping out territories of researchable research topics within
the broader continent that the field's founder(s) had already mapped.
Thus, for example, the turf of artificial intelligence, having
been mapped out in a general way by Herbert Simon and others of
his cohort, subsequently developed well-defined subterritories, such
as AI subfields of "planning" and "machine learning".  In each case,
a student or student-of-a-student of one of the field's founders made
their career by institutionalizing the new subfield: articulating an
emerging theme, building a network around it, organizing meetings and
journals for the network's members, and so on.  There is nothing wrong
with this, of course, if it's done well.  I just want you to see the
pattern.  Similar things have happened in many other fields. </p><p>

Of course, I do not mean to suggest that the process is mechanical,
or that its success is guaranteed.  The AI subfields of "vision" and
"robotics" for example, ended up being institutionally outside the AI
community, simply because the people who were doing well-regarded work
in those areas were largely situated within other communities, such
as neuroscience and mechanical engineering.  So the boundaries between
different research communities are variable. </p><p>

And that brings me to the concept at hand: imperialism.  One way that
fields create new turf is by applying their organizing concepts and
methods to subject matters that have historically been the "property"
of other fields.  Economists of the dominant neoclassical school,
for example, have gone to great lengths to portray all phenomena of
human life, from education to child-rearing to the fine details of
individual cognition, as examples of neoclassical ideas about economic
rationality and allocative efficiency.  Scholars in the fields that
they have invaded, sociologists for example, are often horrified by
the strange and extreme violence that the economists' formalizations
appear to inflict on their proprietary subject matters, and much
gnashing of teeth has ensued, together with some genuine attempts
to build bridges.  Given the workings of the institutions, however,
sniping at the invaders does little good.  So long as they can
institutionalize themselves, establishing organized research
communities whose members are called upon to evaluate one another's
work, external criticism must be taken to the larger and slower court
of public debate and institutional review. </p><p>

Economics is probably the most imperialistic of all research fields,
but the process is nearly universal.  Careers require turf, and they
require coherent communities that can collectively defend their turf.
Research communities therefore try continually to apply their overall
"story" to new subject matters.  These campaigns can lead to faction
and warfare.  Movements can develop pathological ideologies to
justify their imperialism, in extreme cases labeling other work
as "old-fashioned" or denigrating any allocation of resources to
others as "lowering standards".  Other cases are not pathological
at all, and simply represent healthy competition.  The dynamics are
complicated, and they are hard to see, except from the standpoint of
the highly-networked individuals who staff academic hierarchies and
sophisticated funding agencies.  To watch them happening, however, all
you really need are some basic concepts (like the ones I am explaining
here) and the disposition to build far-flung professional networks.
</p><p>

<strong> <a name="segmentary"> (12) Segmentary politics </a> </strong>
</p><p>

As the last several paragraphs suggest, political life in the research
world consists largely of contention for resources among various
research communities.  To get some perspective on these political
processes, it helps to understand the phenomenon that anthropologists
call segmentary politics.  Let us imagine for the moment (simplifying
greatly) that society is organized hierarchically: households belong
to neighborhoods, which belong to towns, which belong to regions,
which belong to nations, which belong to broad cultural groups.
If you look carefully at a town, you might find that the people in
adjacent neighborhoods are continually struggling with one another.
But if one town attacks another, those conflicts might be cast aside
as everyone rallies to the defense of their town.  Rivalries among
towns might likewise subside as tensions arise between regions, but
these tensions might dissolve temporarily when war threatens between
nations, and so on.  Each element of this picture -- a household,
neighborhood, town, region, nation, or broad cultural group -- is
called a "segment", and segmentary politics consists of an endless
negotiation of conflict and solidarity among adjacent segments.
Of course, the picture can be more complicated when groupings cut
across borders, for example in former colonial areas where national
borders are randomly related to the borders among cultural groups.
But even the simple picture is useful as an antidote to the even
simpler picture of undivided national loyalties. </p><p>

As you start participating in the institutional life of your field,
you will probably notice segmentary politics yourself.  Individual
members of a department may dislike one another, but they may find
it in their interest to remain allies in the department's factional
struggles.  Those factional struggles may in turn be put aside when
the department as a whole is threatened in some way, or when various
departments are making their case for increased resources to the
dean.  Within the invisible college of a research community, likewise,
segmentary politics might motivate opposed tendencies to pull together
long enough to present a unified front to a funding agency that is
thinking of starting a new program in their area.  And the different
schools of thought within a discipline might organize to fend off
imperalistic assaults from other disciplines around them. </p><p>

Segmentary politics is distasteful.  In describing it, I certainly
do not mean to praise it.  You will probably find yourself engaging
in it for self-defense if nothing else.  But your real job, in
the long term, is to transcend it.  That is what networking is for.
The broader and stronger your network, the less subject you are
to the randomness of people's local rivalries.  This is one reason
why I have editorialized here against disciplinary bigotry: the
too-common stereotyping of one discipline by another.  The argument
against bigotry can be generalized: the conflicts at every level of
the segmentary hierarchy are usually organized by stereotypes that
have arisen over years, if not decades.  Some of these stereotypes
may perhaps be justified: despite all of your own best efforts to
identify shared values with people in various fields, there may remain
certain intellectual orientations that seem completely worthless
to you.  But at least these will be considered opinions, or as
considered as you can make them, and not the uncritical acceptance
of other people's stereotypes.  And you should remain open, looking
for previously unsuspected points of intellectual or moral contact
with fields that have previously seemed alien to me.  By maintaining
this attitude of openness, you can avoid mindlessly closing yourself
off from potentially new and constructive directions of networking.

<strong> <a name="role"> (13) The role of rational debate </a>
</strong> </p><p>

I've been talking about "politics", but many people at the beginning
of their careers wonder what "politics" means.  After all, many people
equate politics with corruption, and they feel as though engaging in
politics means instant damnation.  It is important, therefore, to get
a positive conception of politics.  A good place to begin is with the
role of rational debate.  To make the problem concrete, let us imagine
a faculty meeting where decisions are being made about which candidate
to hire for a job.  Most such meetings are conducted according to a
formal rulebook such as Robert's Rules of Order that gives everyone
a chance to make motions, offer arguments, call for votes, and so on.
In that sense everyone is formally equal.  But we all know that other
things are going on behind the scenes.  People come into the meeting
with their agendas, their coalitions, and so on.  What, one may well
ask, is the purpose of holding a rational-looking debate, when the fix
is probably already in? </p><p>

Implicit in this way of asking the question are two stories.  On the
first, naive story, everyone has an open mind and wants only the best
for the school and its students.  The naive story suggests that the
meeting will be a shared, rational inquiry into the outcome that is
best for everyone.  On the second, cynical story, everyone is angling
for power.  The cynical story suggests that rational-looking debate
is purely for show, and that the outcome is already set.  In fact, the
reality varies a great deal, and is almost always a mixture of the two
stories.  A healthy academic department will be somewhat fluid in its
politics, neither strictly hierarchical nor rigidly factionalized, but
consisting of a shifting map of different groupings who see things in
different ways, and who need to remain on good terms with one another
because future issues may require them to form unexpected alliances.
In that environment, rational debate does serve a purpose: most issues
will have their undecided swing votes, and whoever communicates best
with those swing voters will win.  Of course, not every department is
perfectly healthy, and human beings will always have failings.  If you
are on the losing side of a harsh political division, then your goal
should be to leave, and networking is the best way to go about that.
</p><p>

Whatever the case, you should understand that "politics", whether
naive or cynical, always starts with the commonalities that people
have established in their discussions with one another.  If you don't
want to become enmeshed in "politics", in the negative sense of that
word, then you should cultivate the skill of identifying points of
intellectual overlap with other people.  Don't let your pride get in
the way by defining your intellectual agenda in one inflexible way.
I'm not asking you to compromise your values, or to pretend to believe
things that you really don't.  There are lots of ways of explaining
various aspects of your intellectual interests, and you will navigate
in political space much more readily if you decide to articulate
the versions of your interests that establish points of contact with
particular people.  Once you do this, the dichotomy between the naive
and cynical pictures of politics starts to break down: you will make
common cause with people in an honest way, and they will understand
that you are on their side.  Political coalitions will emerge in a
natural way, and you will be in the middle of them.  I will discuss
these articulation of commonalities further in the next section. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="reverse"> (14) Reverse engineering </a> </strong>
</p><p>

I want to start the transition to the final section on ethical issues
by making explicit a concept that has been implicit at many points
along the way.  In your new career as a researcher, you are entering
a complicated set of institutions whose participants occupy a variety
of different positions.  You have to deal with these people, and you
will get things done by building consensus with them around ideas and
projects that you find important.  Because these people have different
positions than yours -- department chair, dean, funding agency program
manager, PhD student, journal editor, etc -- communication with them
will not be automatic. </p><p>

Here is a way to think about it.  Everyone has stuff going on in their
heads -- questions, concerns, agendas, precedents, peer pressure, and
so on -- and you can communicate with people better if you understand
how they work.  Partly this means understanding them as individuals,
with their own backgrounds, histories, ideas, peculiarities, whatever.
So if you're going to talk to someone, and something important is at
stake, you should try to talk to someone else who knows them first.
That said, though, much of what's going on inside people depends not
on their personalities but on their positions.  Every dean has certain
concerns, and so does every PhD student, every department chair, and
so on.  If you are talking to someone whose shoes you've walked in,
a PhD student for example, then you have a small chance of empathizing
with their concerns (assuming that you haven't forgotten entirely
what it was like).  But if you are talking to someone whose world you
cannot imagine, such as a dean, then you are likely to make mistakes.
</p><p>

The concept you need is reverse engineering: figuring out what the
people are likely to care about, and then speaking to that.  I am
not talking about manipulation, and I am not talking about telling
people what they want to hear.  The point, rather, is to anticipate
what issues they people will have, and to make sure that what you're
proposing takes those issues into account.  Here is an example.  In
Section 6 on job-hunting above, I described one way to write a letter
of recommendation: gather all the good things you can think to say
about someone, and organize those good things into a coherent story.
That's a pretty good formula.  But a better formula is to start from
the concerns of the people who are likely to be reading the letter.
universities and other research institutions are full of evaluation
processes, and central to all of them is a dilemma: people are made to
prepare defensible evaluations of research in fields where they have
little or no expertise.  Everybody realizes that this is a problem,
and almost everybody is responsible about reaching beyond their own
knowledge.  That is what letters of recommendation are for: they are
evaluations from people who know the work.  Yet those letters don't
fully solve the problem.  Someone has to interpret the letters and
convert them into up-or-down decisions that they can justify.  What
to do? </p><p>

The major idiom for these justifications, it turns out, is comparison.
Is this person the best in their field?  How do they compare to other
people at similar levels of advancement in the field?  How does this
program stand in some magazine's reputational rankings?  That is how
people like CAP (the Committee on Academic Personnel that I mentioned
above) will be thinking.  A letter-writer, therefore, is well-advised
to speak that same language.  An expert recommendation letter will
say things like, "In preparing this letter, I conducted an informal
exercise in which I assembled a list of several other prominent
scholars at this person's level of advancement, and in doing so I
found that this person's work is clearly ahead of the pack in terms
of this, that, or the other thing".  That's reverse engineering. </p><p>

The concept obviously generalizes.  In various sections above, I have
explained what various sorts of people are worried about.  Department
chairs, for example, have to get courses and committees staffed.
PhD students on the sidelines of faculty hiring want to get faculty
hired who can teach the courses they want to take.  In each case,
you can accomplish a great deal by showing that you are aware of
these oncerns.  You don't have to make them your responsibility,
but you should not try to evade them or get around them.  If someone
has a valid concern, then you should get that concern on the table
and cooperate in addressing it.  The situation is harder, of course,
when you're dealing with someone whose concerns are not valid, or
who is presenting concerns as valid that are actually disguises for
other agendas.  In those cases all you can do is put your own valid
concerns on the table and negotiate.  But don't get into the habit of
acting like everyone else's concerns are just negotiating positions.
That's not a healthy way to live. </p><p>

<strong> <a name="demographic"> (15) Demographic tidal waves </a>
</strong> </p><p>

When we speak of the university as an "institution", the suggestion
is that things stay pretty much the same.  But the institution does
change, and you need to understand how.  One source of change is
information technology, but a much more important source of change
is demographics.  Let me just consider the United States.  After
World War II, a huge number of soldiers came home from the war and
went to college on the GI Bill.  The university system expanded
tremendously to accommodate this new wave of students.  Those same
students also had a tremendous number of children, the famous "Baby
Boom", and when those children grew up, the university system kept
expanding to accommodate them as well.  The federal government's
research establishment grew explosively at the same time, and much
of this money went to universities.  These generations -- the GI
Bill and the Baby Boom -- took the concept of an expanding universe
for granted.  The job market was so strong that they could take
chances with their careers.  Beginning in the 1980s, however, that
picture changed.  Student numbers stopped growing dramatically,
and the academic job market contracted accordingly.  Qualified
college teachers were so numerous that many colleges moved
away from tenure-track faculty and toward exploited part-timers.
Academia started getting a bad reputation as a career choice. </p><p>

That situation is about to change, for two reasons: (1) the Baby Boom
generation is going to retire, and (2) the Baby Boom's grandchildren
are headed to college.  The numbers in each case are overwhelming.
The University of California, for example, plans to hire about 7,500
new faculty members in the next ten years -- which is more faculty
than it employs right now.  In fact, higher education planners assert
that it will be physically impossible to accommodate all the students
who will be ready for college over the next decade.  Despite what you
have heard, therefore, this is the best time in human history to be
entering the research field.  The networking skills that I have been
presenting are crucial when the job market is scarce, because the Baby
Boom generation's easygoing career strategies certainly don't suffice.
But networking skills will also be useful during the good times ahead,
when the university will be completely remade in a short period. </p><p>

</p><h3> <strong> <a name="section11">SECTION 11.  Positive Leadership</a>
</strong> </h3> <p>

The previous section has pointed toward the ambivalent nature of the
research world, and as you become well-connected you will start to
face the moral issues that the professional world inevitably brings.
Before talking about those moral issues, though, I want to make sure
that the bad dynamics I've been describing haven't tempted you to
cast off the optimistic and constructive tone of my advice in favor of
the negative stereotypes about networking that prevail in the culture.
Don't become a cynic.  It will make you a bad person and a bad
influence on others.  You really must believe this: if you think that
the whole universe is evil then you are evil yourself.  I do realize
that some people are out there selling their souls.  And the expanding
universe of an emerging discipline will always attract opportunists
who are gung-ho about networking and whose research is simply
a shallow excuse to keep their hand in the network-building game.
That is not the way of life that I am recommending for you, and I
want to make sure that you distinguish between this negative approach
to networking and the positive and constructive approach that I have
been describing.  The main purpose of this section is to make the
distinction between the negative and positive approaches to networking
as clear as possible, in order to help you develop a clear ethical
sense in an unfamiliar professional world. </p><p>

<strong> Research institutions </strong> </p><p>

Let us start with an aerial view.  Imagine yourself in the sky looking
down on millions of researchers, in every field, all continually
building their networks, organizing their conferences, editing their
journals, interviewing for jobs, and so on.  I have described the
process by which these people institutionalize their emerging fields,
but the idea of an institution has a more fundamental meaning as well.
Think, for example, of the institution of a journal.  No laws anywhere
explain how journals ought to run.  Each journal sets its own rules,
based on the sensibilities of the people involved and the precedents
that are available from existing journals that the people are already
familiar with.  A journal editor might introduce small innovations
such as double-blind refereeing (where the referees are not told who
wrote the papers they review) or a department of the journal for short
papers.  A really energetic journal editor might even organize a more
radical change, such as a shift to online publication.  Nonetheless,
the journal as an institution does not change much, for the simple
reason that it is held steady in a force field of the intersecting
incentives that other institutions create.  The academic promotion
process, for example, demands peer review as a formal method of
evaluating a candidate's research, and so few researchers will submit
their research papers to a journal whose procedures do not fit that
model.  A journal establishes its identity and credibility in large
part through the list of prominent researchers who are willing to be
identified with it, and so every journal will have a list of prominent
people on its title page, whether an "editorial committee", "advisory
board", or what-have-you.  Authors expect one another to give credit
where it is due, and peer review gives these expectations teeth,
so the articles in journals are festooned with scholarly apparatus.
Because these converging forces remain much the same over time, the
institution of the research journal remains much the same as well. </p><p>

The same goes for the other institutions that organize life in the
research community, such as the conference, the job interview, the
grant proposal, the advisor-student relationship, and so on.  Over
time, the participants in every institution accumulate and pass down a
body of knowledge about how to pursue individual and collective goals
within the framework that the institution provides, and the whole
purpose of this article is to explain this body of knowledge in very
explicit terms, so that you don't have to learn it by trial and error.
Everybody in the research community, or at least the vast majority
of people who are successful in it, learn and practice this knowledge
to the point that it becomes second nature.  If you study them
from your aerial perspective, you will see them building networks that
you could easily imagine mapping -- and that some scholars actually do
map as part of their own research.  As publications and communications
become increasingly electronic, you could imagine constructing these
maps automatically. </p><p>

It's important to understand how profoundly the buzzing activity of
network-building that you observe is organized and supported by the
institutions.  Recall, for example, the role of the library as a sort
of catalog of potential intellectual friends.  Most people in the real
world do not order their friends from catalogs, for the simple reason
that they do not create the same sorts of elaborate public personae
that scholars create when they publish their research in journals.
In fact, most professions do create incentives to build professional
networks, and many sorts of organizations and directories do exist
to support networking in business and politics, for example.  Even
so, few professions provide the extraordinary level of institutional
support for the process that the research community provides. </p><p>

The dynamics of networking in the research community, however, do not
remain the same over time.  The Internet has certainly accelerated
the process through electronic mail.  In some fields the process has
also been altered substantially by the Web, although I remain struck
at how little effort the average researcher puts into building a Web
presence.  Since most researchers already know personally the finite
world of individuals whose opinions of their work really matter,
and since libraries already make their publications available to
the few people who don't get them by exchanging drafts, researchers
do not have strong incentives to create an elaborate home page.
That's how powerful the existing institutions are: they bond people so
tightly that even the Internet does not radically change the dynamics.
The Internet makes it easier for people in outsider universities
(such as the former students of people at the insider universities)
to stay in the loop, and as I say it speeds everything up.  But the
fundamental phenomenon, the one that drives and shapes the research
community's day-to-day practices, is the complex of institutions that
rewards some activities and not others. </p><p>

That said, I do think that the institutions of research have changed
in one important way over time.  From the aerial perspective, you
could say that the temperature has gone up.  The activity of forming
and reforming networks is more frenetic than it used to be, and less
predictable.  In the old days, fields were stable and hierarchical,
and they had strong boundaries.  You were trained in a field, changing
fields was almost impossible, and the concept of interdisciplinary
research did not exist.  Every field had two or three leading
journals whose editors were kings, and they had one major conference,
held once a year, where faculty introduced their students to the
faculty of other departments in the patriarchal hiring system.  That
old world is hardly gone, but it is changing.  You could say that
we are moving from a world of conferences to a world of workshops.
Where conferences are large and permanent, workshops are small
and temporary.  Some workshops are held year after year, but others
are transient by design.  A conference is an immutable fixture in
its participants' lives, but workshops are organized more or less
spontaneously whenever network-builders such as yourself manage
to articulate emerging themes that motivate a critical mass of
their peers to abandon their research for a few days to participate.
Workshops are indifferent to the boundaries of fields, and they allow
people to join multiple research communities, and to migrate freely
from one research community to another as they seek out new research
topics that fit their interests and talents.  Although it is not
without dangers, I think that this shift toward a more dynamic
research community is basically a good thing, not least because it
calls on everyone to make their own fate by engaging with others.
</p><p>

<strong> Disagreement and pathology </strong> </p><p>

That is the big picture, and I think it is a fairly hopeful one.
Returning to earth, however, I do appreciate that you will have to
deal with the negative and pathological aspects of the institutions
as they actually exist.  Take, for example, the simple fact that many
of your fellow researchers will not share your research interests,
and more importantly your values.  Although networking is very much
a process of picking your friends, nonetheless you will often find
yourself sharing a committee or a department with people who you just
plain disagree with.  What to do?  I have given part of the answer
already: articulate commonalities.  Find something -- anything --
that you agree with them about, and talk about that.  Create a human
bond on any basis at all, have a social conversation with them about
just those topics, and the rest will follow much more easily. </p><p>

The next step in dealing with people you disagree with is to learn
their arguments.  You don't know your own arguments until you can
argue the other side.  The history of philosophy makes clear that
intellectual progress requires that evenly matched schools criticize
one another in detail, so that each side feels compelled to overcome
the criticisms that the other side has presented (see Randall Collins'
book <i>Sociology of Philosophies</i>, mentioned above).  You should
live this deep truth in your own life by really learning the arguments
of the people you disagree with.  You should also search fearlessly
for valid points that your opponents do make amidst their errors.
Make sure that you aren't denying those valid points, just because
your opponents make them.  That sort of denial is dangerous, and
you should make a big point of avoiding it.  For example, if you're an
economist you should admit that markets sometimes fail.  If your work
is situated on the political left then you should admit that crime
is bad.  And don't just admit these points: embrace them.  Don't just
treat them as nasty counterarguments that you immediately trounce with
your brilliant come-backs.  Rather, accept within yourself that the
valid points are valid, and carefully disconnect them from the false
ideas with which they have formerly been associated.  By submitting
yourself to these disciplines, you will accomplish many things.
You will present a smaller target to people who disagree with you.
You will confound their expectations and throw them off-guard.  You
will minimize unnecessary polarization and avoid foreclosing potential
coalitions.  And you will clean the junk out of your own arguments.
People aren't stupid, and you need to believe that the people you
care about respect intellectual honesty.  The arguments that you can't
explain away will compel you to invent new arguments, which after all
is your job. </p><p>

Of course, all of this talk about learning arguments requires people
to fight fair.  But many people, as we all know, do not fight fair.
To deal with these pathological people, you need six ideas: </p><p>

First, you should distinguish between people who are irrational in a
general way and people who are irrational on specific topics.  When
people are irrational on specific topics, it means that they have been
hurt in the past and are afraid that they are going to be hurt the
same way again.  Oftentimes, you will do something reasonable that
superficially resembles a bad thing that some other crazy person did
in some other situation.  For example, you might propose a new course
that falls somewhat outside the usual framework of the curriculum,
not knowing that your department went through years of warfare over
the framework of the curriculum before you got there.  The extreme
response you receive from otherwise rational people will be out
of proportion to anything you actually did.  When you do something
reasonable and encounter an irrational response, therefore, one
approach is to stop and figure out what bad experience the other
person has had.  Then you can assure them that you aren't going
to do the same bad thing that the crazy person did earlier. </p><p>

Second, you should never try to change or fix pathological people,
and you should certainly never persuade yourself that your personal
happiness or success depends on changing or fixing them.  Fixing
pathological people doesn't work in personal relationships, and
it certainly doesn't work in professional relationships.  Release
the miserable people to their misery, refuse to let them into your
space beyond the nice clean boundary that you establish by (only)
articulating commonalities, and carry on with your life. </p><p>

Third, understanding where the pathologies come from will make
the pathological people easier to deal with.  For example, you will
find many assistant professors engaged in pre-tenure psychosis, in
which the uncertainty of the tenure process causes them to become
delusional, adopt self-destructive defenses, play maladaptive
politics, spin conspiracy theories, and generally mess themselves
up.  Not having been admitted to the inner circles of the institution,
they have not sufficiently internalized how the institution works,
and so their imaginations fill the vacuum with whatever basic beliefs
about the world they happen to have gotten from their childhoods. </p><p>

Fourth, you need to tell yourself that pathological people behave
in pathological ways because they do not share the positive and
constructive view of the world that I am explaining in this article.
Pathological people are pathological because they believe that the
world is a fundamentally bad place, and whenever you feel the urge to
send them to hell you should understand that they are already living
in hell.  Of course, when you are confronted with hard-core power
freaks it can be hard to tell yourself this.  If the power freaks
have dug their claws into resources, if they have built an empire of
cronies and serfs, if they have recruited others into their distorted
view of the world, surely there is a real sense in which they have
benefited, is there not?  No, there is not, and this is what you
have to tell yourself.  When Jesus said that the world is corrupt,
and when the Buddha said that the world is illusion, this is what
they were talking about.  Pathological power freaks think they are
in control, but they are hallucinating.  If you convince yourself
that your success and happiness depend on wrestling control of those
hallucinations yourself, then you have locked yourself into the same
reality as they have.  Let go of them.  You will make your success
and happiness through networking in ways that may or may not have been
revealed to you, and that have nothing to do with the illusory power
that pathological people appear to hold. </p><p>

Fifth, if a pathological individual happens to attack you emotionally,
whether through shouting fits or sarcasm or accusations or whatever,
you should learn the proper method for getting the toxins out of your
system.  The key is to revisit the specific details of the situation.
You can do this with your notebook or with a trusted personal friend
(preferably not a professional colleague).  Simply recount the events
in detail.  By "detail" I mean the specific actions and words, step
by step.  Think of yourself as extracting venom from a snakebite,
removing each bit of the venom by deliberately revisiting each element
of the experience.  If you were emotionally hurt, however slightly,
you will find yourself tending to describe the events in a vague way,
for example by giving paraphrases rather than the actual words or by
skipping over details that don't seem important.  This is a mistake.
The purpose of emotional abuse is to subvert the victim's capacity for
rational thought, and you will only regain your rational mind if you
carefully extract the toxins from your system.  If you find yourself
howling for revenge, then you haven't gotten all the toxins out yet.
</p><p>

Sixth, one purpose of networking is to let you escape pathological
people by building your own supportive community.  The stronger and
more extensive your community, the less power the pathological people
will have over you.  Your network is your personal intelligence
system.  Your conversations with other people in your network will
help you understand how different organizations do things, and they
will broaden your thinking by helping you internalize a wider range
of perspectives on the institutions and the research.  When a network
is functioning properly, a kind of electricity runs through it: the
excitement of the research, the affirmation that comes from sharing
that excitement with others, and the confidence that comes from a
continually updated affirmation that your research is finding a real
audience.  The electricity of a functioning network makes pathological
personalities seem less important.  And when you have a network that
is just as big as the pathological person's, that person no longer has
any power over you. </p><p>

<strong> Leadership </strong> </p><p>

Having declared your independence of pathological people and their
established ways of doing things, how <i>will</i> you achieve the
personal success and satisfaction that you seek in your career?  The
general outlines are probably clear enough from my advice so far:
build a network, articulate an emerging theme, organize institutions
around it, build another network, articulate another emerging theme,
organize institutions around that theme, and so on.  It's a cycle.
With each pass through the cycle, you will ascend to a new plateau
in the professional world, and in your career.  You will then build
networks and organize institutions by cooperating with other people
who occupy similar plateaux, having built their own networks and
organized their own institutions back in their home territories.
And then you will use that plateau as a base from which to ascend
once again. </p><p>

The crucial intuition is that the emerging themes will become
more abstract with each pass through the cycle.  When you organize
your first conference panel or journal issue, you will probably
choose an emerging theme that brings conceptual order to the work
of a half-dozen people.  That's fine; it gets you started.  Once
you gain the perspective that a round of professional organizing
affords, however, you will find yourself articulating bigger and more 
encompassing themes, ones that bring order to the research programs
of scores or hundreds of people.  Examples of abstract themes that
help large research movements to coalesce include "neuroscience",
"cultural studies", "communications policy", and "human-computer
interaction" -- in other words, the sorts of phrases you see as
the titles of journals and conferences.  This is where journals and
conferences come from: every one of them started when someone followed
the procedures that I am describing.  The genius of research as an
institution is that it supports this kind of incremental growth: as
a new researcher it is impossible to engage with the voices of every
researcher in the world, so the institutions are arranged to let
you pick a few voices -- the ones that are closely related to your
dissertation topic -- and engage with them.  Then as your career
progresses you can engage with broader and broader ranges of voices.
The meritocracy of research starts with peer review, but its essence
lies in the opportunity that it provides everyone to ascend in their
careers by organizing networks around progressively larger themes.
The justice of the system is that engaging with diverse voices makes
you honest: you are compelled to reconsider your assumptions on ever
deeper levels, and this makes your work more useful to everyone. </p><p>

Of course, intellectual leadership isn't simply coming up with a name,
but talking to everyone and developing a language that lets them all
recognize themselves as members of an emerging community.  This is
leadership in its most general sense, and done honestly it is the best
kind of leadership.  A leader always has a couple of activities in the
works that gather people around emerging themes -- and not just any
people but the people whose work seems in the best sense to represent
the future.  At any given point, then, you will always be involved
in organizing a conference, convening a committee, starting a journal,
putting together a multi-site grant proposal, founding a research
center, or whatever makes sense at a given time.  If you're not
involved in any such activities then you should figure out what the
problem is.  Reconnect with your network, articulate emerging themes,
build consensus, and move forward. </p><p>

<strong> Money </strong> </p><p>

An especially important type of intellectual leadership concerns
research funding.  Every funding agency, whether the government
or a company or a private foundation, maintains a dialogue with the
research community to help articulate the research program that they
want to fund.  Your job as an intellectual leader is to mediate this
dialogue by talking both with your network and with the funders about
where everyone sees things going.  When you talk to people in your
network, you should constantly update your map of the community's
collective research agenda.  Elicit each individual's research agenda,
and then put those research agendas together into orderly wholes.
Keep lists of research topics that come up in conversation, sort the
topics into outlines, and tell clear stories that give the outlines
a unified sense.  This is what emerging themes are for, and by
continually working to articulate emerging themes you will evolve the
language that the research community and the funders use to talk to
one another. </p><p>

This conversation can be organized in many different ways.  The
National Science Foundation, for example, is largely driven by the
research community itself, and intellectual leaders who can organize
workshops and assemble their findings into "white papers" play a
pivotal role in the process.  The incentives to organize such things
are strong: if you write the white paper that NSF draws on in defining
a funding program, then it is likely that your own proposal will
fall squarely within the scope of the program once it gets defined.
Other agencies, public and private, are directed more by their own
agendas, or those of their patrons, but even in those cases your
job is much the same: staying in the conversation and continually
offering a compelling vision of the future direction of research,
based on your honest sense of where the ideas are heading.  Of
course, a dialogue by definition goes both ways, and you also lead
by articulating the genuine insights in the funders' agendas and
synthesizing them with the bottom-up development of agendas in the
research community. </p><p>

This process may sound phony, and it can certainly become phony if it
is done badly.  But believe it or not, the leaders of funding agencies
are usually very intelligent, and their opinions do usually reflect
real insight.  Of course, a failure of leadership can result in a
situation where a powerful funding agency leads the research community
around by the nose, imposing arbitrary agendas on it from the
outside.  But avoiding this kind of failure is precisely what powerful
leadership is about.  Powerful leadership is far-sighted enough that
the relationship with funders is based on a shared vision of emerging
directions for the research. </p><p>

Now, many people do not get excited at the prospect of articulating
research agendas and conversing with funding agencies.  They do not
see themselves as leaders, and they would rather stay in their labs
and libraries doing their work.  I say fine.  It's a free country.
Nonetheless, you have to understand how these things work.  Money for
your research does not materialize from the clouds, and you don't want
to be stranded when the agenda-setting process strays away from the
topics that interest you.  Participating in the process, if only at
a basic maintenance level, means that you retain a degree of control
over your life, as well as an early-warning system that prevents
you from getting stuck later on.  But more fundamentally, as I have
emphasized throughout, the networking process is good for your own
thinking.  Networking serves many functions, but the most important is
as a process of collective cognition.  When you talk to everyone and
listen to their research agendas, and when you write all their agendas
down in front of you and look for the emerging theme that brings order
to them, you are stimulating the most crucial functionality of your
mind: the largely unconscious ability to synthesize fragments into
coherent wholes.  Down deep, everyone has a drive toward wholeness.
This is the force that makes you a more or less integrated human
being and not a schizophrenic mess, and it is also the force by
which like-minded individuals cohere their thinking and form movements
that are intellectually and institutionally stronger than the separate
individuals that make them up.  In a sense, then, deliberately talking
things through with everyone in your network simply amplifies a force
toward wholeness that is already operating in everyone's personality.
The difference is that it's now a force for the collective good, as
well as your own. </p><p>

<strong> Fame </strong> </p><p>

If you have been following my advice, then you are likely to encounter
two perplexing types of situations: meeting famous people and becoming
famous yourself.  Fame has a great power to make people irrational,
and so it will help if you understand where this power comes from, and
how to avoid it.  Presented with an opportunity to meet someone who's
famous, many people turn into idiots.  They think that meeting this
person is a rare opportunity not to be passed up, and they imagine in
a very abstract way that something will come from it.  The reason for
this weirdness is subtle, and it has to do with networking.  We want
to associate with famous people because we imagine (usually correctly)
that famous people have much more wide-ranging networks than we do.
Either the person became famous by building a large network, or else
they became famous in some other fashion and acquired a network as
people started including them in things.  In either case, the magnetic
pull that celebrities exert derives from the idea that they can
connect us to networks that currently lie beyond our reach.  Yet
for that very reason, meetings with famous people can be strange and
pointless.  What do you say to someone who (or so you imagine) already
knows everyone and everything that you do?  This question, happily,
has a simple answer.  Say this: "What are you working on?"  Usually
they're doing something that hasn't been publicized yet, and now maybe
you'll learn about it.  Then, when it's time to talk about yourself,
simply explain your current project that involves gathering people
together -- a workshop, a book, etc.  If you are following my advice
then you have such a project to talk about, and if you have a project
that the famous person could be included in, choose that one. </p><p>

Thinking about these issues in real, practical situations is helpful
practice for the really hard part: becoming famous yourself.  As you
begin networking, you will learn some surprising facts about fame.
One is that fame is relative.  You can be famous -- that is, perceived
and treated as famous -- in a community of a few hundred people.
That means that, much sooner than you think, you will start meeting
people who treat you as if you are famous.  This can be a very strange
experience.  You will find people hero-worshipping you, or projecting
various purely imaginary qualities (good or bad) onto you, or assuming
that you know people and things that you've barely heard of, or
treating you as some kind of political symbol.  When this stuff
happens, your number one temptation is to be a jerk.  You may already
have met your inner jerk back when people started coming to you for
advice, but if not then you will certainly meet your inner jerk now.
All I can say is, be ready. </p><p>

So, should you become famous?  If you wish to excel in a career in
research, then you probably have little choice.  Research requires
you to publish your results, articulate emerging themes for your
field, and build an extensive professional network, and all of these
activities, if done well, lead directly to fame.  You do have some
choices to make about your participation in activities outside the
research world, for example in cultivating a public voice along the
lines that I discussed in Section 3.  But for the most part, having
a public persona is part of the job, and you should think hard ahead
of time about what it means to you and what you want to do with it.
</p><p>

In particular, fame affects relationships.  As you become famous,
you may be distressed to find that you can no longer be friends with
some people that you've known for years -- people who have been turned
into idiots by the prospect of benefitting from their friendship
with you.  Then, if that weren't enough, you might also find that
you can't seem to make any new friends either, since everyone new
is too busy projecting things onto you.  Some people will want to
be friends with you because of your network, and not because of your
personal qualities.  Don't let these phenomena discourage you.  Your
professional networks, after all, are supplying you with large numbers
of people who share your values and interests.  You are effectively
becoming a different person, at least so far as your public persona
is concerned.  You are knitting yourself into a different network of
relationships, and if you have articulated commonalities and emerging
themes that genuinely interest you, then your new relationships will
be just the ones you want. </p><p>

<strong> Beliefs </strong> </p><p>

At several points in this article I have described the self-defeating
beliefs that keep many people from having the careers they want.
Dysfunctional beliefs can come from several sources: </p><p>

 * Messed-up ideas in the general culture, for example the idea that
networking is necessarily greasy, dishonest, burdensome, "political",
or a substitute for "real work". </p><p>

 * Political movements that have run off the rails and try to convince
everyone that the world is infinitely and hopelessly oppressive. </p><p>

 * The dysfunctional cultures of particular occupations or workplaces,
which claim that getting a job requires you to give up your integrity
and commit yourself to work that you do not respect. </p><p>

 * Dysfunctional subcultures of the research world that arise because
people in particular situations -- for example, graduate students or
untenured faculty members -- lack the information they would need to
distinguish between genuine oppression and random paranoia. </p><p>

 * Traumatic experiences, such as having your work plagiarized, that
leave you forever worrying that the same bad thing will happen again,
until that worry blows up into an all-consuming worldview. </p><p>

 * Child abuse, whose survivors often experience the world as an
endless series of abusive situations which they cannot escape. </p><p>

I want to focus particular attention on one mechanism through which
people develop negative beliefs.  Most people get socialized into
institutions such as the research world without anyone ever explaining
how the institutions work.  For example, few PhD students ever get
explicit lessons on the sorts of career strategies that I have been
explaining in this article.  What is more, the social world is filled
with unspoken rules that keep these things hidden, for example the
taboo against boasting or the imperative of explaining one's motives
in terms of the general good rather than in terms of self-interest. 
These unspoken rules help people to get along, but they also make
it much harder for average PhD students in complex professional
interactions to figure out what is really going on.  Most students
do acquire some insight from watching the experts, but they usually
do not develop a complex theory like the one I have been explaining
here.  As a result, they often perceive their social environment in
a relatively superficial way. </p><p>

Let us consider a comparatively mild misconception that can arise
from this sort of superficial perception of the professional world.
Some students develop the idea that a professional network is an
encumbrance.  After all, the more people you know, the more you have
to constrain your voice to avoid saying anything that will offend
anyone.  Isolation is painful, but at least it leaves you free to
speak your mind; the alternative is a life of walking on eggshells.
Right?  Wrong.  People who believe such things fail to understand
how people change when they articulate shared values.  Once you have
created a bond with someone based on the values you share, you can go
ahead and disagree with them.  Having established what you both really
care about, you can easily display your agreement on fundamentals
before going on to explore your differences on details.  If you have
not articulated shared values, then indeed you are likely to step
on some land mines.  The simple fact that they don't know you will
heighten the danger of misunderstanding.  But once you internalize
other people's thinking and allow it to influence your own, these
dangers are much reduced.  Actively engaging with other people is a
way to discover and articulate your own beliefs. </p><p>

More serious hazards arise as students who don't understand the
underlying logic of networking encounter the established power
structures of their field -- that is, the networks that have already
been built by the people who got there first.  Such students often
then imagine that the power structures they encounter are immutable.
They might listen to the players' conversations, but they don't
understand the layers of meaning that people who do understand
networking take for granted.  Then, based on their understanding
of the situation, they devise plans of their own.  And because their
understanding is imperfect, their plans go wrong.  They might try
to break into or circumvent the existing structures, only to commit
a faux pas or provoke a weird misinterpretation.  Or they might try
to conform to the seemingly implacable order of things, only to find
that they are giving up their integrity and getting nothing in return.
They will end up frustrated and alienated, and they will go looking
for someone to explain why. </p><p>

Meanwhile, other students (and faculty with stalled careers) who
have screwed up in similar ways will be feeding them negative ideas:
the game is fixed, it's all about power, you can't win, everyone
is competitive, the whole culture is based on tearing other people
down, and to survive you have to join the culture or drop out.  Those
negative beliefs will always have some slight basis in truth: if you
go around looking for confirming evidence, you will certainly be able
to find it.  But you can find confirming evidence for any belief.  The
fact is, the people who are trying to sell you such negative beliefs
are dangerous.  Their end in life is to justify themselves, and to
that end they want to recruit you.  You should hand them a copy of
"Networking on the Network", and then you should walk away from them
until they get some better beliefs. </p><p>

What exactly is wrong with the people who hold these negative beliefs?
These hazardous people contend, falsely, that the social structures
around them are static, and that they themselves are isolated.
They believe themselves to be powerless, and because they haven't
the faintest idea how power works, they honestly cannot imagine what
it would be like to get any power for themselves.  Is it their fault?
Partly yes, partly no.  It doesn't matter.  What matters is getting
and teaching a more positive view.  The fact is, every one of the
current power-holders of your field acquired their power through the
methods that I have been describing.  They built networks, articulated
emerging themes, organized events, and founded institutions.  Your job
is not to attack them, but to build networks of your own.  Occupy the
new ground that is opening up, and when they retire your network can
inherit the world, assuming that you even want it. </p><p>

Building a rewarding career, then, requires positive beliefs.  Along
the way, I have described some of the positive beliefs that are
necessary in order to approach networking in the most productive and
ethical way.  These include the idea that networking will pay off
somehow in the future, even if the exact mechanism is not yet clear.
In the remainder of this section I want to talk about what I mean by
"beliefs", and I want to describe some of the other beliefs I think
you should have. </p><p>

When I talk about "beliefs", I'm not talking about the intellectual
theories you have in your conscious mind, or anything that you reason
about at a clinical distance or write papers about with fifty-cent
words.  Rather, I'm talking about your fundamental, deep-down way of
relating to the world.  For example, if you believe -- if you take for
granted, if you assume, if you presuppose -- that the whole universe
is fundamentally bad, and that people are fundamentally corrupt, then
I want you to stay away from me, because I submit that you are unable
to approach anything in a positive spirit.  You expect that everyone
is going to shaft you, and so you are going to give up, or act
ironic, or treat everything as a meaningless conspiracy, or go around
preemptively shafting everyone else. </p><p>

I want you to give up those sorts of negative beliefs.  Instead, I
want you to adopt some positive beliefs.  I want you to believe that
you will get a good job, that you are going to have a productive
career, and that you are going to build a supportive network of decent
and intelligent people.  I want you to believe that you will enter
into highly productive lifelong collaborations in which all parties
fully express their talents.  And I want you to believe that you
will build a community whose members continually exchange all manner
of resources and services, such as job-hunting information and
draft-reading. </p><p>

Of course, when I propose these beliefs, it immediately becomes
unclear what "belief" could mean.  I do not mean, for example, that
you are going to think positive thoughts and then sit around waiting
passively for them to become true.  I am not calling for a mindless,
naive optimism.  Nor do I mean that you can just pick people at random
and magically turn them into your productive lifelong collaborators.
No magic here.  Quite the contrary: your good job, productive career,
and supportive network are only going to materialize if you get out
there and build them.  Work is required.  The point is that you have
to undertake this work in the right spirit.  If you treat networking
as an arbitrary chore, or as manipulation, or as social climbing,
or a matter of sucking up to the powerful (which is itself a kind of
manipulation), then you will get a cynical life of phony relationships.
</p><p>

But why?  Why do positive beliefs lead to positive outcomes, and why
do negative beliefs lead to negative outcomes?  Because your beliefs
determine what you see.  If you believe that you can build a network
of supportive people, then you will be looking for supportive people.
Because you will be making distinctions, you will gravitate to the
right people and you will shun the wrong ones.  You won't try to do
things that can't be done, you won't try to organize meetings that
people aren't going to attend, and you won't try to wake people up
who would rather stay asleep.  On the other hand, if you don't believe
that supportive people exist, then obviously you won't be looking for
them.  If you believe that people are all manipulative operators, then
you will be looking for games and schemes and angles, simply asking
yourself which of them best fits the needs of your own manipulations.
When people cannot imagine creating the world they want, and believe
themselves to be living in a finite, zero-sum world instead, they
build a culture of competition and back-stabbing instead of the
positive culture they need.  They act in ways that cause their beliefs
to come true, and then they conclude that they were right all along.
It is only when people believe in a decent world, and are out looking
for the elements of it, and watching for the outlines of it to emerge
from the fragments that they've gathered along the way, that they have
a chance of getting it. </p><p>

So my point here is not that everyone in the world is perfectly good,
or that the whole world is beautiful.  I have repeatedly explained how
you should deal with the evils and pathologies that you do encounter
in the world.  A "belief", in the sense that I am using the word, is
not about the world in general, but about a deeper emotional reality.
The world may be evil on the surface, but you have to believe that
it is positive underneath.  Your job is to cut through the surface
junk and build a positive life.  This is originally a religious idea.
In Christianity it's the idea that you should let go of your own
agenda and let God lead you to the life He means you to have.  But it
also takes secularized forms.  In Marxism, for example, it is the idea
that, below all the division and oppression lies a deeper reality in
which people are sociable and cooperative.  Of course, some Christians
get so wrapped up in sin and punishment that they forget about the
positive aspects of their religion, and some Marxists get so wrapped
up in persuading people that they are oppressed that they forget about
the positive values of social solidarity that supposedly solve the
problem.  Likewise, you need to maintain a clear sense that you can
build a positive career for yourself, and that the details will become
clear once you get out there and start doing it. </p><p>

My advice should be contrasted with the advice that prevails in
American culture, which is to "follow your dreams".  I agree that
following a dream is better than watching television all day.  The
problem with a "dream", however, is that you have no way of knowing,
at the beginning of your journey, what your ideal life should look
like.  Lots of people have "dreams" that are completely disconnected
from reality.  The truth is, the good life that you can build depends
on factors that you simply cannot know about until you start building
networks, articulating emerging themes, and exercising your leadership
capacities.  In order to see what opportunities are out there, you
need to be open to unexpected possibility.  Preconceived scenarios
can only narrow your vision. </p><p>

If you can't come up with a "dream" a priori, then, how should you
proceed?  What should you steer by?  That's what this entire article
has been about.  Start with a research topic that you find compelling.
Do a round of research, hit the library, identify people who should be
part of your network, approach those people, talk to them, articulate
commonalities, let yourself change as a result of those conversations,
see what themes are emerging in the collective work of your community,
follow the directions that you personally find compelling, build
networks around those new directions, and repeat.  Get yourself
embedded in a community of people whose work you respect, and from
that embedded point of view you see what opportunities start to become
visible.  Nobody can start a new institute, for example, unless a lot
of different factors come together.  Likewise, nobody can found a new
field of research just because they have a "dream" in their head to do
so.  It may be part of your path to start a new institute or found a
new field, or it might not.  Let go of those a priori scenarios, and
instead look carefully to see what is being offered to you in the real
world.  Work the process, and choose responsibly among the options it
presents to you. </p><p>

Perhaps the most fundamental belief you need is that you have choice
in your life.  Many people simply assume that their lives are dictated
by others, and that they are completely hemmed in by powers beyond
their control.  This belief is obviously a self-fulfilling prophesy,
but that doesn't explain why it is wrong.  The underlying problem is a
false understanding of the nature of freedom.  For many people, indeed
for the mainstream of Western political theory, freedom means complete
individualistic autonomy -- the power to do just exactly as you please
in your own personal zone of total disconnection.  This belief system
is unfortunate because it provides no way of reconciling freedom
and relationship.  Relationships, on this individualistic view --
relationships of equality, in any case -- are inherently constraining.
At best they represent a trade-off in which individuals surrender
parts of their freedom in order to get something else.  This is
totally confused. </p><p>

I hope to have presented an alternative view: freedom has two levels,
existential and substantive.  On the existential level, freedom means
that you have choice, as I've said.  On the substantive level, freedom
is something that you discover, that you build, through relationships
with others.  You build networks around the issues you care about, you
grow and change through the relationships that result, you articulate
the themes that are emerging in the community's work, and through
community-building and leadership you get the resources to do the
things that you most care about doing.  It's true that this method
will never give you arbitrary power.  But arbitrary power is just
sick.  If you can let go of preconceived plans then you are free:
you can choose whom to associate with, and as you build your network
you multiply the further directions that you can choose to go.  You
also multiply the unexpected opportunities that open up, the places
you can turn for assistance with your projects, the flows of useful
information that keep you in contact with reality, the surveillance
of the horizon that keeps you from getting cornered by unanticipated
developments, and the public persona that ensures that people keep
coming to you with offers that you can take or leave.  That is what
freedom is, and it is yours if you will do the work. </p><p>

<strong> Power </strong> </p><p>

If you follow my advice then you will acquire power.  If you carry
around the prevailing cultural stereotypes about power, then you may
be surprised at the reality of power when it happens.  For example,
simply having a network confers power.  If you know two people, A and
B, who do not know one another, then they might ask you about each
other.  Is this person smart?  A good speaker?  Well-suited to serving
on a certain committee?  That is already a kind of power.  If you
are trapped in a negative, conspiratorial view of the world, then
you will answer these questions in whatever way best suits your own
"side" in some imaginary war.  You may not even be thinking about
whether the person in question is smart, a good speaker, and so on,
but rather about whether it suits your private game to be promoting
or frustrating them. </p><p>

You might even take this mode of operation for granted, having picked
it up from the culture around you, without stopping to reflect on
whether it really serves you.  Besides, being asked about the person
has made you feel important, and exercising arbitrary authority over
them has made you feel even more important.  This kind of nastiness
can become intoxicating, and paradoxically its root cause is the
down-deep belief that you are not powerful, and that your actions have
no real consequences in the world.  It is in such simple situations
-- being asked their opinions of others -- that many people first
face up to the consequences of having actual power in the world,
however slight.  You might serve as a referee for a paper, in which
you can rant intemperately without being known to your victim (though
the editor of the journal will know perfectly well).  You can fail
to mention someone's work to someone else even though it was relevant
to the conversation.  You can go along with stereotypes that distort
the seriousness of another field's research methods.  And, being
intelligent, you can rationalize any of this.  After all, I have
told you myself to shun negative people, and you can tell yourself
that those others are all negative, when in fact they are simply
inconvenient. </p><p>

So right away, early on in your career, the question will arise of
what kind of power you want to have.  It is good to be powerful, but
only in a positive sense of the term.  People with the right kind
of power, in my view, do not need to manipulate or control others.
To the contrary, they are know that they are well-served when others
grow and find their own directions, so they happily support everyone
in their growth.  They don't take responsibility for others' growth,
which is a different question.  They speak to the healthy part
of a person, and they are concerned to draw out and articulate
the brilliant ideas and worthy vision that lie beneath the surface
of whatever anyone is saying.  For example, they don't try to enroll
students as acolytes in their empire-building strategies, but honestly
ask what's best for each student's own development, confident that
their knowledge, vision, and connections will have an important
influence on the student's development in any case.  My point is not
that you should go around being self-abnegatingly altruistic.  My
point is not even that being altruistic is in your best interest.  My
point is that if you follow the advice that I have offered you in this
article, then you will have all of the power that you could possibly
need, and so you will not have any need to hurt anyone.  Lacking all
excuse to be a jerk, you will be able to relax your jerk-being muscles
and ask yourself the amazingly easy and liberating question of what is
involved in being helpful to people. </p><p>

If these considerations seem overly abstract and New Age, let us
consider their consequences for the unfortunate phenomena that I
described in the previous section: professors' incentives to narrow
their students' thinking, and everyone's incentives to defend the
intellectual turf that legitimates their research topics.  These
"incentives" are illusory, of course, but they are deeply ingrained
nonetheless.  Where does the problem come from? </p><p>

You may recall my passing mention of opportunists who do superficial
research as an excuse for empire-building.  And you may well ask
yourself, where is the line here?  How do I know whether I am a
serious, moral individual, or whether I am a superficial operator?
Superficial operators can talk the language of empowerment as well as
anyone, and it is very hard to devise an objective test to distinguish
the operators from the serious people.  The real distinction, down
deep, is that a real leader talks to everyone, thinks deeply into
the ideas, draws to the surface a real insight about the positive
direction where the ideas could be going, and builds consensus around
the result, whereas an operator talks to everyone, sees which way the
wind is blowing, and hustles to get out in front of it.  By networking
widely and listening, the operator hopes to get in on the ground floor
of something, anything, it doesn't matter what -- surfing on issues,
and from one issue to the next.  The real leader is a dynamic force
for an intellectual movement that is positively creative, and that
keeps being creative in the future.  The operator, on the other hand,
is actually a follower, a parasite who has learned how to utter the
words that make people in an emerging intellectual movement feel good.
</p><p>

If the serious scholars don't do their networking, then a vacuum opens
up, and operators will seize the opportunity.  That's one more reason
why serious scholars should build networks.  Even so, the line between
serious scholars and operators is not always clear, and as you get
involved in intellectual leadership, you will definitely feel the
temptation to operate.  You will find yourself saying things because
they mobilize people and not because you really believe them.  And
it's hard to tell the difference, given that being socialized into
a new profession inevitably means learning a new language.  You will
probably sound fake to yourself much of the time, as you learn how
to speak this language, and so it's easy to slip into manipulation
instead of real leadership.  From that kind of manipulation, it is a
short step to the sorts of aggressive empire-building that I described
above: encouraging others to talk your own language rather than
coming up with their own.  That is the deepest moral question that
you will face as you engage in professional networking, and you might
be surprised how quickly you have to face it. </p><p>

</p><h3> <strong> <a name="appendix"> APPENDIX: Some References on
Networking </a> </strong> </h3> <p>

Here are some general guides to professional networking, without any
special reference to electronic mail.  The number of new books about
professional networking accelerated in the mid-1990's, but I haven't
read them systematically. </p><p>

Wayne E. Baker, <i> Networking Smart: How to Build Relationships for
Personal and Organizational Success</i>, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1994.
A fairly comprehensive book on the networking process, with greater
emphasis than most on strategy. </p><p>

Wayne E. Baker, <i>Achieving Success Through Social Capital: Tapping
Hidden Resources in Your Personal and Business Networks</i>, Wiley,
2000.  A new book from Baker that I haven't seen yet. </p><p>

Ann Boe and Betty B. Youngs, <i>Is Your "Net" Working?: A Complete
Guide to Building Contacts and Career Visibility</i>, New York:
Wiley, 1989.  Another book in the same spirit, based on stories
about mistakes people make in their networking activities.  I find
it less useful than the others, but it may well help those who regard
themselves as complete beginners. </p><p>

Jessica Lipnack and Jeffrey Stamps, <i>The Networking Book: People
Connecting With People</i>, New York: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1986.
This book looked useful when I happened across it in a used book store
near the University of New Mexico one day, but I haven't had a chance
to evaluate it yet. </p><p>

Lillian D. Bjorseth, <i>Breakthrough Networking: Building Relationships
That Last</i>, Duoforce, 1996.  Another networking book I haven't read.
</p><p>

Melissa Giovagnoli and Jocelyn Carter-Miller, <i>Networlding: Building
Relationships and Opportunities for Success</i>, Jossey-Bass, 2000.
And another. </p><p>

Tom Jackson, <i>Guerrilla Tactics in the New Job Market</i>, second
edition, New York: Bantam, 1991.  An inspired book on the networking
that's involved in finding a job through the "hidden job market" of
hiring referrals. </p><p>

Thomas J. Stanley, <i>Networking With the Affluent and Their
Advisors</i>, Homewood, IL: Irwin, 1993.  This book is probably
the least directly relevant to research people, as should be obvious
from its title, but nonetheless it should be a good resource for
those wishing to think more deeply about professional networking.
Its focus is on the different roles that someone can play as part
of a network. </p><p>

Ford Harding, <i>Rain Making: The Professional's Guide to Attracting
New Clients</i>, Holbrook, MA: Bob Adams, 1994.  Another business book
that might be useful in the same indirect way. </p><p>

And here are a few references for literature on contemporary patterns of
networking: </p><p>

Howard E. Aldrich and Mary Ann von Glinow, Personal networks and
infrastructure development, in David V. Gibson, George Kozmetsky, and
Raymond W. Smilor, eds, <i>The Technopolis Phenomenon: Smart Cities,
Fast Systems, Global Networks</i>, Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield,
1992.  Approaches to rationalizing and managing the networking process
through social psychology, network mapping, and systematic development
of networks. </p><p>

Thomas J. Allen, <i>Managing the Flow of Technology: Technology
Transfer and the Dissemination of Technological Information within
the R&amp;D Organization</i>, Cambridge: MIT Press, 1977.  A scary book of
experimental and quantitative studies of information flow in groups of
research and development people.  Many of the results are things that
you've always known but that hardly anybody acts as if they really
believed, for example that the most productive groups enjoyed a steady
flow of ideas from other groups and other disciplines. </p><p>

Pierre Bourdieu, <i>Homo Academicus</i>, translated from the French by
Peter Collier, Cambridge: Polity Press, 1988.  A difficult and perhaps
cynical but nonetheless very insightful sociological study of the ways
in which academics accumulate capital through the symbolic politics of
their writings and institutions.  Bourdieu himself was a master of the
art and should know. </p><p>

Ronald S. Burt, <i>Structural Holes: The Social Structure of
Competition</i>, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1995.  This
research makes precise the intuition that influence derives from a
social network that bridges different worlds.  More of Burt's research
can be found at <a href="http://gsbwww.uchicago.edu/fac/ronald.burt/research/" target="new">http://gsbwww.uchicago.edu/fac/ronald.burt/research/</a> .
</p><p>

Diana Crane, <i>Invisible Colleges: Diffusion of Knowledge in
Scientific Communities</i>, Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1972.  A highly influential study of academic social networks.
Because these networks cut across the boundaries of individual
colleges, they are called "invisible colleges". </p><p>

Patrick Doreian and Frans N. Stokman, eds, <i>Evolution of Social
Networks</i>, Amsterdam: Gordon and Breach, 1997. </p><p>

Neil Fligstein, Social skill and the theory of fields, <i>Sociological
Theory</i> 19(2), 2001, pages 105-125.  A summary of the place of
social skill in sociology.  Remarkably, social skill was a neglected
topic until recently.  This particular theory is largely concerned
with the workings of power in a given sector of society.  It draws in
concepts from several other areas, but its argument is very similar to
that of Machiavelli. </p><p>

Neil Fligstein, Social skill and institutional theory, <i>American
Behavioral Scientist</i> 40(4), 1997, pages 397-405.  An earlier
article on the same topic. </p><p>

Oscar H. Gandy, Jr., The political economy of communications
competence, in Vincent Mosco and Janet Wasko, eds, <i>The Political
Economy of Information</i>, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press,
1988.  An interesting article about the role of communication skills
in reproducing social inequalities. </p><p>

Bernard Michael Gilroy, <i>Networking in Multinational Enterprises:
The Importance of Strategic Alliances</i>, Columbia: University of
South Carolina Press, 1993.  The economics behind ongoing changes
in the workings of global companies, in which the boundaries of the
enterprise are less clear and employees' own networks have increasing
economic consequences. </p><p>

Mark Granovetter, The sociological and economic approaches to labor
market analysis: A social structural view, in George Farkas and
Paula England, eds, <i>Industries, Firms, and Jobs: Sociological
and Economic Approaches</i>, New York: Plenum Press, 1988.  Presents
evidence demonstrating that people get jobs because of who is in
their professional networks, and argues that simple economic ideas
about supply and demand do not suffice to explain such things. </p><p>

Mark Granovetter, <i>Getting a Job: A Study of Contacts and
Careers</i>, second edition, Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1995.  The same. </p><p>

Kerry Grosser, Human networks in organizational information
processing, <i>Annual Review of Information Science and Technology</i>
26, 1991, pages 349-402.  A survey article about social networks in
organizations and their role in passing information around. </p><p>

Edward O. Laumann and David Knoke, Policy networks of the
organizational state: Collective action in the national energy
and health domains, in Robert Perrucci and Harry R. Potter,
eds, <i>Networks of Power: Organizational Actors at the National,
Corporate, and Community Levels</i>, New York: Aldine de Gruyter,
1989.  A really interesting empirical study of shifting alliances
within networks of people trying to affect policy-making in
Washington. </p><p>

Myrna P. Mandell, ed, <i>Getting Results Through Collaboration:
Networks and Network Structures for Public Policy and Management</i>,
Westport, CT: Quorum, 2001. </p><p>

Nitin Nohria and Robert G. Eccles, eds, <i>Networks and Organizations:
Structure, Form, and Action</i>, Boston: Harvard Business School
Press, 1992.  A big collection of papers about networks in industry
-- mostly in the sense of "social networks", with little reference to
to computer networks.  I find this kind of work to be somewhat sterile
in its foundations but occasionally revealing in its observations.
Its attention to questions of power is refreshing, up to a point
anyway. </p><p>

Constance Perin, Electronic social fields in bureaucracies,
<i>Communications of the ACM</i> 34(12), 1991, pages 75-82.  Some
ideas about the informal networks within organizations that get
connected together with electronic mail, often scaring their managers
in the process. </p><p>

Robert P. Singh, <i>Entrepreneurial Opportunity Recognition Through
Social Networks</i>, New York: Garland, 2000. </p><p>

Lee Sproull and Sara Kiesler, <i>Connections: New Ways of Working in
the Networked Organization</i>, Cambridge: MIT Press, 1991.  A general
study of organizational uses of electronic mail. </p><p>

social networks: Collaborative work, telework, and virtual community,
<i>Annual Review of Sociology</i> 22, 1996, pages 213-238.  A
survey of research on the role of computer networks in creating and
transforming social networks.  Many common cybermyths are exploded in
a satisfying way. </p><p>

Here are some comparative studies of networks and networking in
various cultures: </p><p>

Randall Collins, <i>The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of
Intellectual Change</i>, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998.
</p><p>

Thomas Gold, Doug Guthrie, and David Wank, eds, <i>Social Connections
in China: Institutions, Culture, and the Changing Nature of
Guanxi</i>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. </p><p>

Andrew B. Kipnis, <i>Producing Guanxi: Sentiment, Self, and Subculture
in a North China Village</i>, Durham: Duke University Press, 1997. </p><p>

Alena Ledeneva, <i>Russia's Economy of Favours: Blat, Networking, and
Informal Exchanges</i>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998.
</p><p>

Alejandro Portes, ed, <i>The Economic Sociology of Immigration: Essays
on Networks, Ethnicity, and Entrepreneurship</i>, New York: Russell
Sage Foundation, 1995. </p><p>

Robert D. Putnam, <i>Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in
Modern Italy</i>, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993.
An interesting and influential book about the role of civic life
in encouraging both democracy and prosperity.  Putnam describes the
centuries-old pattern in which northern Italy, where people run their
lives by gathering into a wide variety of associations, is generally
a happier and healthier place than southern Italy, where people
look out for themselves and engage in hierarchical, clientelistic
relationships.  The basic point applies to the professional world as
well. </p><p>

Annelise Riles, <i>The Network Inside Out</i>, Ann Arbor: University
of Michigan Press, 2000. </p><p>

Barry Wellman, ed, <i>Networks in the Global Village: Life in
Contemporary Communities</i>, Boulder: Westview, 1999.  A theoretical
introduction to the study of personal social networks, followed by
comparative studies in several countries and online. </p><p>

Yunxiang Yan, <i>The Flow of Gifts: Reciprocity and Social Networks in
a Chinese Village</i>, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1996. </p><p>

Also there's this: </p><p>

Thorstein Veblen, <i>The Higher Learning in America</i>, New
Brunswick, NJ: Transaction, 1993.  Originally published in 1918.
One aspect of the university as an institution that I haven't much
discussed in this article is its relationship to commerce.  There is
a significant literature on the subject, which you can easily enough
locate with the library catalog.  Still I'll mention this, the first
and best book on the topic.  Veblen argues that learning ought to be
self-governing and independent of commercial pressures. </p><p>

Finally, here are several books that might provide general guidance
and orientation to graduate students and others in academia.  I
haven't read most of them, but if you do then please let me know
what you think. </p><p>
