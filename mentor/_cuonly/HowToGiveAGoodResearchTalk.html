<h2><a name="Abstract">Abstract</a></h2>

<p>Giving a good 
research talk is not easy. We try to identify some things which we 
have found helpful, in the hope that they may be useful to you. 
</p>

<i>This paper appears in SIGPLAN Notices 28(11) (Nov 
1993).</i>



<h2><a name="About">1 What this paper is 
about</a></h2>
<a href="#Top">Top</a>

<p>By a "research talk" we 
mean a presentation of 30-60 minutes, given to a group of people who 
are motivated and intelligent, but who may not know much about your 
particular area.</p>

<p>The paper is heavily on our personal 
experience of giving talks in the area of Computing Science.  What we 
have to say is quite different from what business people are often 
taught, but perhaps that's due mainly to a difference in the style of 
presentation needed for technical material.</p>

<p>Papers like this 
one often tend to consist mainly of "motherhood" statements, with 
which nobody could possibly disagree (such as "prepare well"), and 
thereby  end up with little real punch.  We have tried to avoid this, 
partly by deliberately overstating some things (the title, for 
example)  in order to make our points more vividly.</p>

<p>We make 
no claim to have all the answers; rather, we have simply tried to 
write down suggestions which have worked for us in the hope that they 
may be useful to you.  Everyone is different, so take what is useful 
for you, and ignore the rest.</p>


<h2><a name="Say">2 What to 
say</a></h2>
<a href="#Top">Top</a>

<p>You should usually see your 
talk <i>primarily as a ``taster'' for your work, rather than as an 
in-depth treatment</i>.  So two very useful questions to ask are 
these:</p>

<ul>

<li>Who is my primary audience?</li>

<li>If 
someone remembers only one thing from my talk, what would I like it 
to be?.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you have the answer to these questions 
pinned down, you can use them as criteria when deciding what to say 
and what to omit.  And don't forget to tell the audience the answer 
to the second question!</p>


<h3><a name="Examples">2.1 Using 
examples</a></h3>


<p>Most of us do research by trying to solve a 
bunch of related problems, finding some suitable framework in which 
to solve them, and then generalising and abstracting our solution. 
For example, if the problem is to find out whether a function 
evaluates its argument, then a suitable framework might be 
denotational semantics, and a generalisation might be abstract 
interpretation.</p>

<p>The Awful Trap is to present only the 
framework and the abstraction, leaving out the motivating examples 
which you used to guide your work. Many talks are far too abstract. 
They present slide upon slide of impressive-looking squiggles, but 
leave the audience none the wiser.</p>

<p>It is utterly vital to 
present examples which demonstrate the points you are trying to make. 
When you give a definition of a property, or a mathematical 
structure, or some new notation, give examples to show what the 
definition captures.  When you give a theorem, give examples to show 
what it means in practice.</p>

<p>Of course in a written paper you 
must be careful to fill in the details, and state precisely what is 
going on (though a good paper has plenty of motivating examples too). 
With any luck, your talk will persuade your listeners to read your 
paper, but a talk is the wrong medium in which to demonstrate your 
mathematical virtuosity.</p>

<p>The need to motivate and illustrate 
your talk with examples is probably the most important single point 
in this paper, because so many talks fail to do so.  Ask yourself 
again and again: <i> "Have I illustrated this 
idea/theorem/definition/technique/algorithm with an 
example?"</i>.</p>


<h3><a name="Pruning">2.2 Pruning: saying enough 
without saying too much</a></h3>


<p>The tension is this: you need 
to say enough to convey the essential content of your idea, but you 
must not overwhelm your audience with too much material.</p>

<p>The 
best way out of this dilemma is to adopt a non-uniform approach to 
your talk; that is, treat some aspects in more detail than others. 
It may be painful not to talk about the other parts, but it is better 
than only giving a superficial treatment to everything, or 
over-running your time.</p>

<p>Given that there are bound to be 
people in your audience who don't know the area at all, some overall 
introduction/motivation is usually essential.  But do avoid the 
temptation of spending five or ten minutes on rambling introductory 
remarks.  Sometimes, for example, people start with a slide listing 
prior work on the subject of the talk, or with an abstract 
description of what the talk is about.</p>  

<p>Don't waste time on 
this --- instead jump straight in with an example
which demonstrates 
the problem you are addressing.  Remember: if you
bore your audience 
in the first few minutes you may never get them
back.</p>


<h3><a name="Telling">2.3 Telling it how it is</a></h3>

<p>Avoid the 
temptation to conceal problems you know about in your work.
Not only 
is it dishonest: it is also ineffective.  A bright audience will
find 
you out.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you are open about the difficulties, 
you may find that someone makes a suggestion which turns out to be 
just what you need. Get your
audience to help you do your 
research!</p>



<h2><a name="Visual_aids">3 Visual aids</a></h2>
<a href="#Top">Top</a>

<p>Use an overhead projector.  A research talk 
is just too short to be
able to give a sensible development on the 
blackboard, and 35mm slides
take far too much preparation. (There are 
exceptions, of course. For
example, in graphics talks, 35mm slides 
are often necessary, and
sometimes even video.  In this case, 
minimise technology intrusion by
minimising changes between 
overheads, slides and video.)</p>

<h3><a name="Technology">3.1 
Technology</a></h3>


<p>Write your overhead slides by hand, rather 
than use LaTeX or other machine-based typesetting technology, unless 
your handwriting is utterly abysmal, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It frees 
you from having to prepare the entire talk before leaving for your 
trip.Handwritten slides in the middle of a typeset sequence look all 
wrong.</li>

<li>It makes it easy to use colour.</li>

<li>It makes 
it vastly easier to draw diagrams, add little arrows and bubbles, and 
so on.  Of course this can be done by computer, but it is much, much 
slower.</li>

<li>It is all too easy to be seduced by the apparent 
neatness of typesetting. Remember that time you spend fiddling with 
the typesetting is time you are <i>not</i> spending on the content. 
</li>

<li>Typesetting adds to the temptation to write a slide that 
contains too much information, because it will still "fit".  If you 
do typeset your slides, use a large font (at least 17pt).  Thismakes 
your slides physically more legible, and usefully limits how much 
will fit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally, there are times when it is better 
to use the odd slide or two of typeset material --- computer output 
for example.</p>

<p>Use permanent-ink overhead projector pens.  This 
is very important.  
The water-soluble kind rapidly get tatty and 
smudged (if your hands don't sweat when you are speaking your 
physiology is different to ours), and their colours are much less 
vivid.  You can get plastic erasers for such pens, so you can still 
correct mistakes.</p>

<p>Throw away the flimsy tissue-paper backing 
which come with OHP slides.
Instead use ordinary paper from your 
recycling box.  They get in much
less of a mess, and you can write 
notes on the backing sheet to remind you
of points you want to make 
which don't appear on the slide itself.</p>

<p>Consider writing your 
slides "sideways" (landscape-style).  This allows you to write 
larger, increasing legibility, and usefully limits how many things 
you can write.</p>

<p>Overlays (combined with use of colour) can be 
very helpful when presenting complicated examples, because they 
reduce the amount of new material to read on each successive slide. 
However, much of the advantage is lost if you pick up the slides to 
align them properly: the audience can't keep their eye on the old 
stuff to see what's new.</p>


<h3><a name="Silde_content">3.2 What 
to put on a slide</a></h3>

<p>When writing slides remember that 
people can read and take in only very little information. Six or 
seven "things" on one slide is quite enough.</p>

<p>Slides shouldn't 
repeat what you plan to say, but they should emphasise it; don't 
waste visual bandwidth on things you are also going to say. People 
who copy their paper onto slides and then read from them are 
immensely irritating. You should plan to talk ABOUT what's on your 
slides, not read it. (This may mean you need separate notes to remind 
you of what you want to say.)</p>

<p>It is conventional to start 
with a contents slide, giving the outline of your talk.  Don't.  It 
takes a precious minute to talk through it,
 and your audience won't 
understand it till later. Certainly never include such trivia as 
"introduction", "conclusion". These are understood as a necessary 
part of every talk.</p>

<p>On the other hand, about a third of the 
way through, it can be quite helpful to draw breath with a slide 
which says ``This is what I have discussed so far, and now I'm going 
on to cover these areas'', or some such.  This can help to re-orient 
your audience, and make it clear that this is the moment to ask 
questions if they are lost already.  Another way to add signposts is 
to begin each section of your talk with a slide containing only the 
title of the section.</p>


<h3><a name="Slide_prep">3.3 Preparing 
slides</a></h3>

<p>Don't start writing slides too early.  It is 
Parkinsonian process: it simply expands to fill the time available. 
So don't make too much time available.  As indicated earlier, we 
often mull over what we are going to say for a week or two 
beforehand, but only actually write the slides the night before. 
This has the merit that the material is absolutely fresh in your mind 
when you give the talk, though you do need to have a clear idea in 
advance of what you are going to say.</p>

<p>Regard with extreme 
prejudice the temptation to pull out old slides from previous talks, 
and glue them together into a new talk.  It almost always shows. 
Somehow the old slides are never quite appropriate.  (It's fine to 
simply repeat a complete previous talk, of course.)</p>


<h2><a name="Give_talk">4 Giving the talk</a></h2>
<a href="#Top">Top</a>

<h3><a name="nerves">4.1 Nerves</a></h3>

<p>If 
you don't feel nervous before giving a talk, especially to a large or 
unfamiliar audience, you are a most unusual person.  Between us we 
have given hundreds of talks, but the feeling that your legs just 
won't support you when you stand up in front of all those people 
never goes away.  Do try steady, deep breathing beforehand, and 
relaxation exercises, but don't expect to feel 
calm.</p>

<p>Remember: the person who just gave that confident, 
assured presentationbefore you almost certainly felt just the 
same.</p>

<p>If you can make eye contact with your audience, then do 
so. A talk is greatly improved if the audience recognise they are 
being <i>talked to</i> rather than being <i>talked 
at</i>.</p>


<h3><a name="Presenting">4.2 Presenting your 
slides</a></h3>

<p>Some people hide most of their slide under a 
piece of paper, revealing it line by line, as they go through it. 
Occasionally this is just the right thing to do, but people quite 
often do it all the time, which we find a very irritating habit. 
Perhaps it helps to focus you listener's attention on the part you 
are talking about, but it is als rather condescending (``you can't be 
trusted to listen to me if I show you the next line too''). If you 
find yourself wanting to use this technique, ask yourself whether the 
material would not be better split over two slides.</p>

<p>There are 
exceptions: when you have a punchline to reveal, for example, or when 
you need to emphasise that something proceeds stage by stage; but it 
is a technique to use very sparingly. The inexperienced speaker 
especially doesn't need the extra hassle of messing about with a bit 
of paper.</p>

<p>An overriding goal must be to make the slides 
themselves as invisible as possible. It is the content that is 
important. This leads to a couple of other don'ts: don't use slides 
with a rip-off backing sheet; don't use a ring binder to hold your 
slides during the talk, especially if you open and close it between 
each pair of slides; don't switch off the  overhead projector between 
slides. Each of these emphasises the existence of the slides as 
entities in their own right.</p>

<p>The only reason you use an 
overhead projector is so that people can see your slides. So don't 
block their view. For this reason it is often better to point at the 
screen than at the slide. In a big lecture room a pointer can help 
with this, but try not to bang the screen with it -- it makes 
everyone else's eyes go funny.</p>

<h3><a name="Timing">4.3 
Timing</a></h3>

<p>Don't over-run.  It is selfish and rude.  Either 
you will be cut off by the chairperson before you have reached your 
punchline, or you will compress others' talks, or you will make 
everyone late.  In any case, you audience's attention span is 
limited, so you probably won't manage to convey much in your 
over-time period.</p>

<p>As you get more experienced, you will learn 
how long a single slide lasts in your talks. The average for most 
people is probably 2 to 3 minutes.  Plan a couple of places where you 
can leave out a bunch of slides, and check your watch when you get to 
them.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to have a couple of slides at the end 
of your talk which you can use in the unlikely event that you finish 
early, but which you usuallyexpect not to use.</p>

<a href="#Top">Top</a>

<p>So 
there you have it. As we said in the introduction, our suggestions 
are simply ideas that we have found work for us; we hope they may 
work for you also.</p>

<p>Without a doubt it is worth putting 
thought and effort into presentationskills.  Your work, no matter how 
brilliant, becomes valuable to others only in so far as you 
communicate it to them.</p>
