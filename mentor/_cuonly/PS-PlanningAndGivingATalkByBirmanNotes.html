<h2 align=center> Planning and Giving a talk </h2>
<h4 align=center> Ph.D. Professional Seminar. 2 April 1997. </h4>
<h4 align=center> Ken Birman </h4>

<hr>
The focus of this talk is how to prepare a professional seminar
or presentation. This is very different from preparing a lecture.
Even though most students have experience watching and
evaluating talks, this does not make evident all of the
details involved in preparing and giving a professional talk.

Possibly the most important issue in giving a talk are your
timing and the flow of the talk. It is also key to think about
how detailed the talk should get, how to structure the material
and how to talk to an audience in an effective way. However,
more than all this, good timing is vital.

<hr>
There are different types of talks, ranging from a course
lecture to a short presentation at a conference or workshop
of specialists in your field to a short talk to a broader
audience to a long talk to a general audience, as for a
job interview. Each of these types of talks have different
audiences. In professional talks (as compared to class
lectures) the audience has higher expectations of the
speaker. The speaker must aim at involving the experts in
the audience, not just the middle of the group.

<hr>
Key messages to get from this talk:

<ul>
<li> Know your audience. Decide what you want them to learn from
your talk.
<li> Go slowly even if you need to omit detail.
<li> Include that hard technical core, even if you only convey the
flavor or thrust of the argument.
<li> Say less, but say it clearly and forcefully.
<li> Adapt as you go. Don't read the slides.
</ul>

<hr>
Some important things that you should do:

<ul>
<li> Only plan on conveying one "idea" per 20 minutes allocated.
More information than this cannot be effectively included. However,
an idea isn't just a single sentence, it is a developed region
of your talk. Using the focus of one or two "ideas" which are
developed in the course of your talk is a useful structuring
technique as well.

<li> Engage your audience. If you don't, they will lose interest.
Tips on this are given below.

<li> Each talk should "peak" with a central 10 minutes or so of
hard, core material. If your presentation is technical, you may
lose some of your audience here. This is the one time in your
talk that that will be acceptable, so long as you are teaching
the rest of your audience.

<li> As an engineer, you must relate your work to the real world.
Be sure to make this connection in your talk.

<li> Remember to reiterate your key themes throughout the talk.

</ul>

<hr>
Here are some sample timelines for different types of talks:

<ul>
<li> 20 minute talk to specialists:
<ul>
<li> 2 minutes warmup
<li> 5 minutes to state model and problem
<li> 5 minutes for core results
<li> 5-8 minutes for prior work and recap/summary
</ul>
<li> 20 minute talk to a general audience:
<ul>
<li> 5 minutes warmup
<li> 5 minutes to state model and problem
<li> 5 minutes for core results
<li> 3-2 minutes for prior work and recap/summary
</ul>
<li> 50 minute talk to specialists:
<ul>
<li> 5 minutes warmup
<li> 10 minutes to state model and problem
<li> 25 minutes for core results
<li> 5-3 minutes for prior work and recap/summary
</ul>
<li> 50 minute talk to a general audience:
<ul>
<li> 10 minutes warmup
<li> 10 minutes to state model and problem
<li> 15 minutes for core results
<li> 10-15 minutes for prior work and recap/summary
</ul>
</ul>

The warmup will set the context and tell the audience why they
should care about the problem. It is all right to spend a lot of
time stating the problem. If the problem is not well stated the
rest of the talk will appear unmotivated. If the problem is
presented well, the audience will be led easily into the direction
you are going.

Prior work should be mentioned, but it should be saved to the
end. At the beginning of the talk it is only taking time away
from you. The exception to this rule is an A exam, where you
should put the prior work first.

<hr>
Sizing up the audience

<p>
Try to find out in advance who your audience will be. If this is
not possible, assume a general audience. However, you should also
assume that your audience is full of very smart people who lack
background on your topic. The audience is doing you the favor of
listening to you. Your job is to convince them that the topic is
interesting and important and that they should read the paper. The
role of the talk is not to educate but to advertise.

<hr>
When you give a talk, you should be introduced. It is the job of
the person who invites you to introduce you. To help, provide them
with a little information on yourself. If you are not introduced,
start with a one-sentence self-introduction; be brief.

<hr>
If your talk, or one of your results is based on joint work, be sure
that you say so. However, do not spend a long time on a list of names.
Just mention that the work was joint "with the people listed" on
your overhead. Do not minimize your role in the work though,
especially in an interviewing talk. Indicate which work is yours.
At the end of the talk, give a quick summary running through a list
of the nature of your contributions. Avoid lists of names or lists
of results.

<hr>
Things not to do/mistakes not to make:

<ul>
<li> Do not get too detailed. A talk should convey the style and
impact of your work but usually can't cover the real details.
Don't include details that are too small, say too much about
things that are not central to your talk or let your slides get
too packed. More on this below.

<li> Losing your sense of timing is a big problem. Many talks
drift. However, it takes years of practice to get timing right
without a clock visible. It is probably a good idea to have a
clock with you, in case there isn't one that you can see in
the lecture room. Watches are not a great time source because
they are too hard to check. Don't trust time keepers; they tend
to wake up one minute before your slot ends and are only good for
cutting you off. Having your timing be off is particularly bad
if you allow yourself to get disoriented or panic. Try to
recover gracefully. Some ideas on dealing with timing are
given below.

<li> Never, ever let yourself run over the allocated time for
the talk. Even if you start late. Even if you are interrupted
with questions. Even if you are told you can run over, unless
they insist, and then you should at least pause at the
scheduled ending time to let any who needs to leave do so.

<li> Don't go out on a limb. If you don't know something, don't
fake it.

<li> Outlines aren't necessarily a good thing. Try to use
an alternative method of guiding your audience through your
talk. Ideas for this are given below.

<li> Covering slides is insulting and annoying. Don't do it.

<li> Abuse of pointers is confusing. It also makes you talk at
the screen rather than the audience. Point only when absolutely
necessary.

<li> Never read your slides to the audience.

<li> Avoid lists; they are very boring. It is okay to have a list on
a slide, but if you do, don't read the whole thing. Use it to indicate
that there are many things which fall under the category of this
list, but then focus on only one or two items.

<li> Don't let questions throw you off your timing. Try to answer
briefly and move on. More suggestions on this are given below.

<li> Don't apologize; believe in your talk.
</ul>

<hr>
Getting too detailed

<p>
Most speakers wish they could present their hardest technical
results. But most audiences aren't looking for that. Only a
few people in your audience will appreciate what you actually
did. Instead, focus on defining the problem and why it is
interesting and the overall tone of your work. Don't rush to
reach the "good stuff"; if you go too fast at the beginning
the audience won't understand why the problem matters. This
means that you will have at most 10 minutes for the real meat
of the talk. When you get there, make it clear that it is
interesting and why. It is okay to lose them here, but make
sure you pick them up again in your recap.

<p>
While you are being careful to give the big picture, make sure
that you don't omit the core of your work. The audience expects
the talk to have a core insight and they want to learn from you.
Build up to your core, then hit them with your basic results,
place the results with respect to prior work and end with a
recap which places what you did in context again, including
pointers for future work and a visionary closing sentence.

<hr>
Alternatives to outlines

<p>
You don't need to have an outline for your talk. It may not even
be desirable. Of course, even if you omit showing your audience
an outline, you should have one in your head and you should
express the spirit of it to your audience. Let them know what
to expect. More importantly, let them know why the talk is
interesting and what your innovation concerns. This includes
explicitly stating what you are going to show them and why this
is interesting, emphasizing who would benefit from this work,
positioning your work in the area and explaining the importance
of the result. Then, when you reach your result, remind them of
what you promised to show them. Remind them again that you have
met this promise at the summary.

For you as a speaker, have a sense relative to your mental outline
of what your goals are and how long they take you to meet. This
will help if you have to adjust your timing.

<hr>
Tips on engaging your audience

<ul>
<li> Talk to them, not the slides or the blackboard.
<li> Pause after key points and let them soak in.
<li> Relax. Look at the audience. Enjoy yourself. Take your time.
<li> A little humor never hurts, but limit it.
<li> Look at the room when you speak and watch to see if they
are following you.
<li> Pause often and look around.
</ul>

If your audience looks bored, perhaps you are getting too detailed;
make sure that you motivate the talk in general terms. You might
be going too fast and losing them; in this case slow down and be
more clear, or skip detail. If you are simply failing to "engage"
the audience, look at them and talk to them.

<p>
If your audience is making you uncomfortable, instead of looking
at individuals, look at gaps between them or at the rear walls.
Make sure you continue looking out towards the audience; don't
look at the slides or the blackboard. Concentrate on speaking in
one minute "chunks" and then look at the audience during the
pauses and focus on what you are saying in between. Slow down
even if you need to skip details. Hit the important points and
remind them why this matters and how it relates to the big
picture.

<hr>
Dealing with timing problems

<p>
Think ahead of time about what matters most in the talk and what
points you really want to communicate. Keep these in mind at all
times.

<p>
It isn't necessary to hit every point on every slide. In fact, many
good speakers look at the slide they are showing but then "ignore it"
and focus on the audience. It is normal to skip a point on a slide or
even an entire slide. The audience doesn't want to be read to. If
you start to fall behind, just skip ahead, making sure that you hit
your main important points. During your wrap-up you can have a few
words on what you didn't have time to cover.

<p>
Don't put too much on a slide. Trust powerpoint font sizes and
margins. Then use as a rule of thumb that slow speakers need
to count on 2 minutes per slide and faster speakers can perhaps
get as little as 1.5 minutes per slide.

<p>
Your talk might start late. In fact, most seminar start about
five minutes late. Introductions cut out of your time as well.
Plan on this. Sometimes circumstances cause a long delay in
the start of your talk. In this case, ask if you should try
and end on time or if not when you should stop. When you are
forced to trim back, think hard and be sure to hit your key
points anyhow. It is a good idea to have an idea ahead of time
about how you can cut your talk if it becomes necessary.

<p>
Timing must be balanced with getting your information across
effectively. For the audience to understand your hard technical
core, go slowly through the hard material. If you have formulas,
ask for two projectors. This way you can leave key slides, such
as your model definition, up on one and talk next to the other.
Whenever you show a formula, you must give your audience time
to read and understand it. Point out the key things, though
not every detail. Speak slowly and to the point.

<hr>
Using pictures is good. Figures are intrinsically interesting; they
will help keep your audience involved. However, it is not always
possible to use them, such as in this talk. Where you can use a
figure, graph or clip art to convey an idea, you may save a lot
of text. However, you must take the time to explain the figure, and
figures take more time than textual slides. Spurious figures are
not a good idea, though. Similarly, use of "special effects" should
be limited.

<hr>
Presenting theoretical results

<p>
You can't show the audience everything that you did. Instead, show
them a key theorem or two, instead of all eight or ten of them.
Explain how your proof works for these sample theorems. Then state
the other theorems but don't give the proofs. This works especially
well if you can pick a theorem to present that gives the flavor of
the proofs of the other ones as well. Remember that even brilliant
people can be lost in details. Pick the point that you want to make
and focus on it.

<hr>
Practice makes perfect

If you don't practice a talk in front of people, your timing will
often be wrong. Pick people to practice in front of that you can
trust to give you serious feedback. If possible, practice in front
of a general audience; this will be more typical of your actual
audience than practicing in front of your research group. The
criticisms of a talk need to focus on the overall organization
first and then on the details. Most of your criticisms will
probably be in terms of details, though, so try to listen to the
"spirit" of the advice and find the larger scale problems that they
are pointing to.

<hr>
Using a blackboard

<p>
Think ahead about what the board should look like and where the
information will end up with respect to each other. As always, you
must design the material to assist the audience. Think about how
it will look to them. When writing, you can read your writing but
don't speak on the subject until you are done. You can also write
and then turn to the audience and read them what you wrote.

<hr>
Handling questions

<p>
Questions during your talk can throw your timing off. Answer questions
briefly. If you do not understand the question, rather than asking
for a clarification, guess at what the question should have been and
restate it in your own words. Only use a sentence or two to answer.
If the question is on a topic that you will cover soon, say that you
have a slide on the question in a moment and when you reach that slide
point it out.

<p>
Sometimes questioners will get more aggressive. They may not
agree with you and will start to give a seminar on their reasons.
In this case, gently thank him or her and say that you really
need to move on now. You should answer a question once, and briefly,
but avoid getting drawn into a debate. However, be sure not to
seem to be evading the questioner if he or she as a real point.
If the question gets to the heart of your talk, it may be best
to spend a little more time dealing with the question.

<p>
At the end of your talk, if you have done a good job, you should
expect 2 or 3 questions. Answer them politely and briefly. If
the questioner is aggressive, complement the question but then
explain your perspective briefly. Do not get defensive; always
be polite. If you do not get any questions, smile and thank
them for inviting you. On the other hand, if you do receive
questions, make sure to watch the time. If the question period
starts to stretch beyond 5 minutes or so either stop the questioning
period but offer to take more questions up front or let the rest
of the audience know that they are welcome to leave while you
continue to take questions from those who are still interested.
