<h3><b><a name="advisor_relationship"></a><hr>Getting the most out of
the relationship with your reseach advisor or boss</b></h3>

<ul>
   <li><b>Meet regularly</b> - you should insist on meeting once a
   week or at least every other week because it gives you motivation
   to make regular progress and it keeps your advisor aware of your
   work.
   
   </li><li><b>Prepare for your meetings </b>- come to each meeting with:
   
   <ul>
      <li>List of topics to discuss
      
      </li><li>Plan for what you hope to get out of the meeting
      
      </li><li>Summary of you have done since your last meeting
      
      </li><li>List of any upcoming deadlines
      
      </li><li>Notes from your previous meeting
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li><b>Email him/her a brief summary of EVERY meeting </b>- this
   helps avoid misunderstandings and provides a great record of your
   research progress. Include (where applicable):
   
   <ul>
      <li>Time and plan for next meeting
      
      </li><li>New summary of what you think you are doing
      
      </li><li>To do list for yourself
      
      </li><li>To do list for your advisor
      
      </li><li>List of related work to read
      
      </li><li>List of major topics discussed
      
      </li><li>List of what you agreed on
      
      </li><li>List of advice that you may not follow
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li><b>Show your advisor the results of your work as soon as
   possible </b>- this will help your advisor understand your
   research and identify potential points of conflict early in the
   process.
   
   <ul>
      <li>Summaries of related work
      
      </li><li>Anything you write about your research
      
      </li><li>Experimental results
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li><b>Communicate clearly - </b>if you disagree with your
   advisor, state your objections or concerns clearly and calmly. If
   you feel something about your relationship is not working well,
   discuss it with him or her. Whenever possible, suggest steps they
   could take to address your concerns.
   
   </li><li><b>Take the initiative </b>- you do not need to clear every
   activity with your advisor. He/she has a lot of work to do too.
   You must be responsible for your own research ideas and progress.
</li></ul>

<h3><b><a name="read"></a><hr>Getting the most out of what you
read</b></h3>

<ul>
   <li><b>Be organized</b>
   
   <ul>
      <li>Keep an electronic bibliography with notes &amp; pointers
      to the paper files
      
      </li><li>Keep and file all the papers you have read or skimmed
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li><b>Be efficient</b> - only read what you need to
   
   <ul>
      <li>Start by reading only the conclusion, scanning figures
      &amp; tables, and looking at their references
      
      </li><li>Read the other sections only if the paper seems relevant or
      you think it may help you get a different perspective
      
      </li><li>Skip the sections that you already understand (often the
      background and motivation sections)
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li><b>Take notes on every paper you find worth reading </b>
   
   <ul>
      <li>What problem are they trying to solve?
      
      </li><li>What is their approach?
      
      </li><li>How is it different from other approaches?
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li><b>Summarize what you have read</b> <b>on each topic</b> -
   after you have read several papers covering some topic, note the:
   
   <ul>
      <li>key problems
      
      </li><li>various formulations of the problem they are addressing
      
      </li><li>relationship among the various approaches
      
      </li><li>alternative approaches
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li><b>Read PhD theses </b>- even though they are long they can be
   very helpful in quickly learning about what has been done is some
   field. Especially focus on:
   
   <ul>
      <li>Background sections
      
      </li><li>Method sections
      
      </li><li>Your advisor's thesis - this will give you an idea for what
      he/she expects from you.
   </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h3><b><a name="progress"></a><hr>Making continual progress on your
research</b></h3>

<ul>
   <li><b>Keep a journal of your ideas </b>- write down everything
   you are thinking about even if you think it is stupid. It will
   help you keep track of your progress and keep you from going in
   circles. Do not plan to share it with anyone, so you can write
   freely.
   
   </li><li><b>Set some reasonable goals with deadlines </b>
   
   <ul>
      <li>Identify key tasks that need to be completed
      
      </li><li>Set a reseasonable date for completing them (on the order
      of weeks or months).
      
      </li><li>Share this with your advisor or enlist your advisors help
      in creating the goals and deadlines.
      
      </li><li>Set some deadlines that you must keep (e.g., volunteer to
      give a student seminar on your research, work toward a
      conference paper submission deadline, etc.)
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li><b>Keep a to do list </b>- Checking off things on a to do list
   can feel very rewarding when you are working on a long-term
   project.
   
   <ul>
      <li>List the small tasks that can be done in about an hour
      
      </li><li>Pick at least one that has to be completed each day
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li>Continually update your:
   
   <ul>
      <li><b>Problem statement</b>
      
      </li><li><b>Goals</b>
      
      </li><li><b>Approach </b>(or a list of possible approaches)
      
      </li><li><b>One-minute version</b> of your research (aka the
      elevator ride summary)
      
      </li><li><b>Five-minute version </b>of your research
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li><b>Discuss your research with anyone who will listen -</b> use
   your fellow students, friends, family, etc. to practice discussing
   your research on various levels. They may have useful insights or
   you may find that verbalizing your ideas clarifies them for
   yourself.
   
   </li><li><b>Write about your work </b>
   
   <ul>
      <li>Early stage: Write short idea papers and share them with
      your advisor and colleagues.
      
      </li><li>Intermediate stage: Find workshops and conferences for
      submitting preliminary results. This can also help you set
      deadlines.
      
      </li><li>Advanced stage: Target relevant journals.
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li><b>Avoid distractions </b>- it is easy to ignore your research
   in favor of more structured tasks such as taking classes, teaching
   classes, organizing student activities, creating web pages like
   this, etc. Minimize these kinds of activities or committments.
   
   </li><li><b>Confront your fears and weaknesses </b>
   
   <ul>
      <li>If you are afraid of public speaking, volunteer to give
      lots of talks.
      
      </li><li>If you are afraid your ideas are stupid, discuss them with
      someone.
      
      </li><li>If you are afraid of writing, write something about your
      research every day.
   </li></ul>
   
   </li><li><b>Balance reading, thinking, writing and hacking </b>- often
   research needs to be an iterative process across all of those
   tasks.
</li></ul>

<h3><b><a name="research_select"></a><hr>Finding a thesis topic or
formulating a research plan</b></h3>

<ul>
   <li>Pick something<b> you find interesting </b>- if you work on
   something solely because your advisor wants you to, it will be
   difficult to stay motivated.
   
   </li><li>Pick something <b>your advisor finds interesting </b>- if your
   advisor doesn't find it interesting he/she is unlikely to devote
   much time to your research. He/she will be even more motivated to
   help you if your project is on their critical path (although this
   has down sides too!).
   
   </li><li>Pick something the<b> research community will find interesting
   </b>-if you want to make yourself marketable.
   
   </li><li>Make sure it <b>addresses a real problem</b>
   
   </li><li>Remember that<b> your topic will evolve </b>as work on it
   
   </li><li>Pick something that is<b> narrow enough </b>that it can be
   done in a reasonable time frame
   
   </li><li>Have realistic expectations (i.e.<b> Don't expect the Nobel
   Prize</b>)
   
   </li><li>Don't worry that you will be stuck in this area for the rest
   of your career. It is very likely that <b>you will be doing very
   different research </b>after you graduate.
</li></ul>

for in a good advisor, mentor, boss, or committee member</b></h3>
