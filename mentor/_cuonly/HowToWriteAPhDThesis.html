This guide to thesis writing gives simple and practical advice on
the problems of getting started, getting organised, dividing the
huge task into less formidable pieces and working on those pieces. It also
explains the practicalities of surviving the ordeal. It includes a suggested
structure and a guide to what should go in each section.
It was originally written for graduate students in physics, and most
of the specific examples given are taken from that discipline. Nevertheless,
the feedback from users indicates that it has been widely used and appreciated
by graduate students in diverse fields in the sciences and humanities.<p>

<a name="start"><h2>Getting Started</h2></a>
When you are about to begin, writing a thesis seems a long, difficult task. That is because it is a 
long, difficult task. Fortunately, it will seem less daunting once you have a couple of chapters done. 
Towards the end, you will even find yourself enjoying it---an enjoyment based on satisfaction in the 
achievement, pleasure in the improvement in your technical writing, and of course the approaching 
end. Like many tasks, thesis writing usually seems worst before you begin, so let us look at how 
you should make a start.
<p>

<a name="outline"><h3>An outline</h3></a>
First make up a thesis outline: several pages containing chapter headings, sub-headings, some figure 
titles (to indicate which results go where) and perhaps some other notes and comments. There is a 
section on chapter order and thesis structure at the end of this text.
Once you have a list of chapters and, under each chapter heading, a reasonably complete list of things 
to be reported or explained, you have struck a great blow against writer's block. When you sit down 
to type, your aim is no longer a thesis---a daunting goal---but something simpler. Your new aim is 
just to write a paragraph or section about one of your subheadings. It helps to start with an easy one: 
this gets you into the habit of writing and gives you self-confidence. Often the Materials and Methods 
chapter is the easiest to write---just write down what you did; carefully, formally and in a logical 
order.
<p>

How do you make an outline of a chapter? For most of them, you might try the method that I use for 
writing papers, and which I learned from my thesis adviser: assemble all the figures that you will use 
in it and put them in the order that you would use if you were going to explain to someone what they 
all meant. You might as well rehearse explaining it to someone else---after all you will probably 
give several talks based on your thesis work. Once you have found the most logical order, note 
down the key words of your explanation. These key words provide a skeleton for much of 
your chapter outline.
<p>

Once you have an outline, discuss it with your adviser. This step is important: s/he will have useful 
suggestions, but it also serves notice that s/he can expect a steady flow of chapter drafts that will 
make high priority demands on his/her time. Once you and your adviser have agreed on a logical 
structure, s/he will need a copy of this outline for reference when reading the chapters which you will 
probably present out of order.  If you have a co-adviser, discuss the outline with him/her as well, and 
present all chapters to both advisers for comments. 
<p>

<a name="organisation"><h3>Organisation</h3></a>
It is encouraging and helpful to start a filing system. Open a word-processor file for each chapter 
<i>and 
one for the references.</i> You can put notes in these files, as well as text. While doing something for 
Chapter n, you will think "Oh I must refer back to/discuss this in Chapter m" and so you put a note to 
do so in the file for Chapter m. Or you may think of something interesting or relevant for that chapter. 
When you come to work on Chapter m, the more such notes you have accumulated, the easier it will be to write.
<p>

<i>Make a back-up of these files and do so every day at least</i> (depending on the reliability of your computer and the age of your disk drive). Do not keep back-up disks close to the computer in case 
the hypothetical thief who fancies your computer decides that s/he could use some disks as well.<p>
A simple way of making a remote back-up is to send it as an email attachment to a consenting email correspondent, preferably one in a different location. You could even send it to yourself if your server saves your mail (in some email packages like Eudora this is an optional
setting). In either case, be careful to dispose of superseded versions so that you don't waste disk space, especially if you have bitmap images or other large files. 
<p>

You should also have a physical filing system: a collection of folders with chapter numbers on them. 
This will make you feel good about getting started and also help clean up your desk. Your files will 
contain not just the plots of results and pages of calculations, but all sorts of old notes, references, 
calibration curves, suppliers' addresses, specifications, speculations, letters from colleagues etc., 
which will suddenly strike you as relevant to one chapter or other. Stick them in that folder. Then put 
all the folders in a box or a filing cabinet. As you write bits and pieces of text, place the hard copy, 
the figures etc in these folders as well. Touch them and feel their thickness from time to time---ah, the 
thesis is taking shape.
<p>

If any of your data exist only on paper, copy them and keep the copy in a different location. Consider 
making a copy of your lab book. This has another purpose beyond security: usually the lab book 
stays in the lab, but you may want a copy for your own future use. Further, scientific ethics require 
you to keep lab books and original data for at least ten years, and a copy is more likely to be found if 
two copies exist.
<p>

While you are getting organised, you should deal with any university paperwork. Examiners have 
to be nominated and they have to agree to serve. Various forms are required by your department and 
by the university administration. Make sure that the rate limiting step is your production of the 
thesis, and not some minor bureaucratic problem.

<a name="wordprocessors"><h3>A note about word processors</h3></a>
One of the big FAQs for scientists: is there a word processor, ideally one compatible with MS Word, but which allows you to type mathematical symbols and equations conveniently? One solution is LaTeX, which is powerful, elegant, reliable, fast and <i>free</i> from <a href= "http://www.latex-project.org/">http://www.latex-project.org/</a> or <a href= "http://www.miktex.org/">http://www.miktex.org/</a>.  As far as I know, the only equation editor for MS Word is slow and awkward. (If anyone knows a way of writing equations in this software without using the mouse, many people including this author would like to hear from you!) Another solution is to use old versions of commercial software. Word 5.1 allows equations to be typed comfortably: it is faster in this respect than LaTeX, with the added advantage of 'what you see is what you get' (WYSIWYG). (If anyone knows how to run Word 5.1 on OSX, please let me know!) A search will find sites that provide discontinued software, but, not knowing whether this is legal or not, I shan't link to them. (I am told that LyX, available free at http://www.lyx.org/, is a convenient front-end to LaTeX that has WYSIWYG. ) <p>
Commercial word processors have gradually become bigger, slower, less reliable and more awkward to use as they acquire more features. This is a general feature of commercial software and an important input to the computing industry. If software and operating system performance did not deteriorate, people would not need to buy new computers and profits would fall for makers of both hard- and soft-ware. Software vendors want it to look fancy and obvious in the demo, and they don't really care about its ease, speed and reliability to an expert user because the expert user has already bought it. In our example, it is much faster to type equations and to do formatting with embedded commands because you use your fingers independently rather than your hand and because your fingers don't leave the keyboard. However, click-on menus, although they are slow and cumbersome when typing, look easy to use in the shop.<p>

<a name="timetable"><h3>A timetable</h3></a>
I strongly recommend sitting down with the adviser and making up a timetable for writing it: a list of dates for when you will give the first and second drafts of each chapter to your adviser(s). This structures 
your time and provides intermediate targets. If you merely aim "to have the whole thing done by [some distant date]", you can deceive yourself and procrastinate more easily. If you have told your adviser that you will deliver a first draft of chapter 3 on Wednesday, it focuses your attention. <p>
You may want to make your timetable into a chart with items that you can check off as you have finished them. This is particularly useful towards the end of the thesis when you find there will be quite a few loose ends here and there.
<p>

<a name="solution"><h3>Iterative solution</h3></a>
Whenever you sit down to write, it is very important to write <i>something.</i> So write something, 
even if it is just a set of notes or a few paragraphs of text that you would never show to anyone else. It would be nice if clear, precise prose leapt easily from the keyboard, but it 
usually does not. Most of us find it easier, however, to improve something that is already written 
than to produce text from nothing. So put down a draft (as rough as you like) for your own 
purposes, then clean it up for your adviser to read. Word-processors are wonderful in this regard: in the first draft you do not have to start at the beginning, you can leave gaps, you can put in little notes 
to yourself, and then you can clean it all up later.
<p>

Your adviser will expect to read each chapter in draft form. S/he will then return it to you with 
suggestions and comments. <i>Do not be upset if a chapter---especially the first one you write---
returns 
covered in red ink.</i> Your adviser will want your thesis to be as good as possible, because his/her 
reputation as well as yours is affected. Scientific writing is a difficult art, and it takes a while to learn. 
As a consequence, there will be many ways in which your first draft can be improved. So take a 
positive attitude to all the scribbles with which your adviser decorates your text: each comment tells 
you a way in which you can make your thesis better.
<p>

As you write your thesis, your scientific writing is almost certain to improve. Even for native 
speakers of English who write very well in other styles, one notices an enormous improvement in the 
first drafts from the first to the last chapter written. The process of writing the thesis is like a course 
in scientific writing, and in that sense each chapter is like an assignment in which you are taught, but 
not assessed. Remember, only the final draft is assessed: the more comments your adviser adds to 
first or second draft, the better.
<p>

Before you submit a draft to your adviser, run a spell check so that s/he does not waste time on 
those. If you have any characteristic grammatical failings, check for them. 
<hr>

<a name="what">
<h2>What is a thesis? For whom is it written? How should it be written?</h2></a>

Your thesis is a research report. The report concerns a problem or series of problems in your area of 
research and it should describe what was known about it previously, what you did towards solving it, 
what you think your results mean, and where or how further progress in the field can be made.
Do not carry over your ideas from undergraduate assessment: a thesis is not an answer to an 
assignment question. One important difference is this: the reader of an assignment is usually the one 
who has set it. S/he already knows the answer (or one of the answers), not to mention the 
background, the literature, the assumptions and theories and the strengths and weaknesses of them. 
The readers of a thesis do not know what the "answer" is. If the thesis is for a PhD, the university 
requires that it make an original contribution to human knowledge: your research must discover 
something hitherto unknown.
<p>

Obviously your examiners will read the thesis. They will be experts in the general 
field of your thesis but, on the exact topic of your thesis, you are the world expert. Keep this in 
mind: you should write to make the topic clear to a reader who has not spent most of the last three 
years thinking about it.
<p>

Your thesis will also be used as a scientific report and consulted by future workers in your laboratory 
who will want to know, in detail, what you did. Theses are occasionally consulted by people from 
other institutions, and the library sends microfilm versions if requested (yes, still). More commonly theses are 
now stored in an entirely digital form. These may be stored as .pdf files on a server at your university. The advantage is that your thesis can be consulted much more easily by researchers around the 
world. (See e.g. <a href="http://adt.caul.edu.au/">Australian digital thesis project</a> for the digital availability of research theses.) Write with these possibilities in mind.
<p>

It is often helpful to have someone other than your adviser(s) read some sections of the thesis, 
particularly the introduction and conclusion chapters. It may also be appropriate to ask other members 
of staff to read some sections of the thesis which they may find relevant or of interest, as they may be 
able to make valuable contributions. In either case, only give them revised versions, so that they do 
not waste time correcting your grammar, spelling, poor construction or presentation. 
<p>

<a name="detail"><h3>How much detail?</h3></a>
The short answer is: rather more than for a scientific paper. Once your thesis has been assessed and 
your friends have read the first three pages, the only further readers are likely to be people who are 
seriously doing research in just that area. For example, a future research student might be pursuing 
the same research and be interested to find out exactly what you did. ("Why doesn't the widget that 
Bloggs built for her project work any more? Where's the circuit diagram? I'll look up her thesis." 
"Blow's subroutine doesn't converge in my parameter space! I'll have to look up his thesis." "How 
did that group in Sydney manage to get that technique to work? I'll order a microfilm of that thesis 
they cited in their paper.") For important parts of apparatus, you should include workshop drawings, 
circuit diagrams and computer programs, usually as appendices. (By the way, the intelligible 
annotation of programs is about as frequent as porcine aviation, but it is far more desirable. You
wrote that line of code for a reason: at the end of the line explain what the reason is.)
You have probably read the theses of previous students in the lab where you are now working, so 
you probably know the advantages of a clearly explained, explicit thesis and/or the disadvantages 
of a vague one.
<p>

<a name="clear"><h3>Make it clear what is yours</h3></a>

If you use a result, observation or generalisation that is not your own, you must usually state where 
in the scientific literature that result is reported. The only exceptions are cases where every researcher in the field already knows it: dynamics equations need not be followed by a citation of Newton, circuit analysis does not need a 
reference to Kirchoff. The importance of this practice in science is that it allows the reader to verify 
your starting position. Physics in particular is said to be a vertical science: results are built upon results which in 
turn are built upon results etc. Good referencing allows us to check the foundations of your additions 
to the structure of knowledge in the discipline, or at least to trace them back to a level which we judge to be reliable.
Good referencing also tells the reader which parts of the thesis are descriptions of previous 
knowledge and which parts are your additions to that knowledge. In a thesis, written for the general 
reader who has little familiarity with the literature of the field, this should be especially clear.
It may seem tempting to leave out a reference in the hope that a reader will think that a nice idea or an 
nice bit of analysis is yours. I advise against this gamble. The reader will probably think: "What a 
nice idea---I wonder if it's original?". The reader can probably find out via the library, the net or even 
just from a phone call.
<p>

If you are writing in the passive voice, you must be more careful about attribution than if you are writing in the active voice. "The sample was prepared by heating yttrium..." does not make it clear 
whether you did this or whether Acme Yttrium did it. "I prepared the sample..." is clear.
<p>

<a name="style"><h3>Style</h3></a>
The text must be clear. Good grammar and thoughtful writing will make the thesis easier to read. 
Scientific writing has to be a little formal---more formal than this text. Native English speakers should 
remember that scientific English is an international language. Slang and informal writing will be 
harder for a non-native speaker to understand.
<p>

Short, simple phrases and words are often better than long ones. Some politicians use "at this 
point in 
time" instead of "now" precisely because it takes longer to convey the same meaning. They 
do not care about elegance or efficient communication. You should. On the other hand, there will be times when you need a complicated sentence 
because the idea is complicated. If your primary statement requires several qualifications, each 
of these may need a subordinate clause: "When [qualification], and where [proviso], and if 
[condition] then [statement]". Some lengthy technical words will also be necessary in many
theses, particularly in fields like biochemistry. Do not 
sacrifice accuracy for the sake of brevity. "Black is white" is simple and catchy. An advertising
copy writer would love it. "Objects of very different albedo may be illuminated differently so
as to produce similar reflected spectra" is longer and uses less common 
words, but, compared to the former example, it has the advantage of being true. The longer
 example would be fine in a physics thesis
because English speaking physicists will not have trouble with the words. (A physicist who
did not know all of those words would probably be glad to remedy the lacuna either from
the context or by consulting a dictionary.)
<p>
Sometimes it is easier to present information and arguments as a series of numbered points, 
rather than as one or more long and awkward paragraphs. A list of points is usually easier to write.
You should be careful not to use this presentation too much: your thesis must be a connected, 
convincing argument, not just a list of facts and observations.
<p>
One important stylistic choice is between the active voice and passive voice. The active voice ("I measured the 
frequency...") is simpler, and it makes clear what you did and what was done by others. The passive voice ("The 
frequency was measured...") makes it easier to write ungrammatical or awkward sentences. If you 
use the passive voice, be especially wary of dangling participles. For example, the sentence "After 
considering all of these possible materials, plutonium was selected" implicitly attributes 
consciousness to plutonium. This choice is a question of taste: I prefer the active because it is clearer, more 
logical and makes attribution simple. The only arguments I have ever heard for avoiding the active voice in a thesis are (i) many 
theses are written in the passive voice, and (ii) some very polite people find the use of "I" immodest.  Use the first person singular, not plural, when reporting work that you did yourself: the editorial 'we' may suggest that you had help beyond that listed in your acknowledgments, or it may suggest that you are trying to share any blame. 
On the other hand, retain plural verbs for "data": "data" is the plural of "datum", and lots of scientists like to preserve the distinction. Just say to yourself "one datum is ..", "these data are.." several times.
An excellent and widely used reference for English grammar and style is <i>A Dictionary of Modern 
English Usage</i> by H.W. Fowler.
<p>

<a name="presentation"><h3>Presentation</h3></a>
There is no need for a thesis to be a masterpiece of desk-top publishing. Your time can be more 
productively spent improving the content than the appearance.
<p>

In many cases, a reasonably neat diagram can be drawn by hand faster than with a graphics package, and you can scan it if you want an electronic version. 
Either is usually satisfactory. A one bit (i.e. black and white), moderate resolution scan of a hand-drawn sketch will be bigger than a line drawing generated on a graphics package, but not huge. While talking about the size of files, we should mention that photographs look pretty but take up a lot of memory. There's another important difference, too. The photographer thought about the camera angle and the focus etc. The person who drew the schematic diagram thought about what components ought to be depicted and the way in which the components of the system interacted with each other. So the numerically small information content of the line drawing may be much more useful information than that in a photograph.<p>

Another note about figures and photographs. In the digital version of your thesis, do not save ordinary photographs or other illustrations as bitmaps, because these take up a lot of memory and are therefore very slow to transfer. Nearly all graphics packages allow you to save in compressed format as .jpg or .gif files. Further, you can save space/speed things up by reducing the number of colours. In vector graphics (as used for drawings), shades or grey are often produced by black and white pixels, so one-bit colour is adequate.
<p>

In general, students spend too much time on diagrams---time that could have been spent on examining 
the arguments, making the explanations clearer, thinking more about the significance and checking 
for errors in the algebra. The reason, of course, is that drawing is easier than thinking.
<p>

I do not think that there is a strong correlation (either way) between length and quality. There is no 
need to leave big gaps to make the thesis thicker. Readers will not appreciate large amounts of vague 
or unnecessary text.
<p>

<h3>Approaching the end</h3></a>
A deadline is very useful in some ways. You must hand in the thesis, even if you think that 
you need one more draft of that chapter, or someone else's comments on this section, or
some other refinement. If you do not have a deadline, or if you are thinking about postponing
it, please take note of this: <i>A thesis is a very large work. It cannot be made
perfect in a finite time</i>. There will inevitably be things in it that you could have done better. There will be
inevitably be some typos. Indeed, by some law related to Murphy's, you will discover one 
when you first flip open the bound copy. No matter how much you reflect and how many 
times you proof read it, there will be some things that could be improved. There is no point
hoping that the examiners will not notice: many examiners feel obliged to find some examples
of improvements (if not outright errors) just to show how thoroughly they have read it. So set 
yourself a deadline and stick to it. Make it as good as you can in that time, and then hand it in!
(In retrospect, there was an advantage in writing a thesis in the days before word processors,
spelling checkers and typing programs. Students often paid a typist to produce the final
draft and could only afford to do that once.)

<a name="copies"><h3>How many copies?</h3></a>
Talk to your adviser about this. As well as those for the examiners, the university libraries and 
yourself, you should make some distribution copies. These copies should be sent to other researchers who 
are working in your field so that:
<ul>
<li>      they can discover what marvellous work you have been doing before it appears in journals;
<li>    they can look up the fine details of methods and results that will or have been published more 
briefly elsewhere;
<li>    they can realise what an excellent researcher you are. This realisation could be useful if a post-
doctoral position were available in their labs. soon after your submission, or if they were 
reviewers of your research/post-doctoral proposal. Even having your name in their bookcases might 
be an advantage.
</ul>
<p>


Whatever the University's policy on single or double-sided copies, the distribution copies could be 
double-sided paper, or digital, so that forests and postage accounts are not excessively depleted by the exercise. Your 
adviser could help you to make up a list of interested and/or potentially useful people for such a 
mailing list. Your adviser might also help by funding the copies and postage if they are not covered 
by your scholarship. A CD with your thesis will be cheaper than a paper copy. You don't have to burn them all yourself: companies make multiple copies for several dollars a copy. 
<p>

The following comment comes from Marilyn Ball of the Australian National University in Canberra: 
"When I finished writing my thesis, a postdoc wisely told me to give a copy to my parents. I would 
never have thought of doing that as I just couldn't imagine what they would do with it. I'm very 
glad to have taken that advice as my parents really appreciated receiving a copy and proudly 
displayed it for years. (My mother never finished high school and my father worked with trucks 
- he fixed 'em, built 'em, drove 'em, sold 'em and junked 'em. Nevertheless, they enjoyed having 
a copy of my thesis.)"
<p>
<a name="personal"><h3>Personal</h3></a>
In the ideal situation, you will be able to spend a large part---perhaps a majority---of your time writing 
your thesis. This may be bad for your physical and mental health.
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Typing</dt>
<dd> Set up your chair and computer properly. The Health Service, professional keyboard users or 
perhaps even the school safety officer will be able to supply charts showing recommended relative 
heights, healthy postures and also exercises that you should do if you spend a lot of time at the 
keyboard. These last are worthwhile insurance: you do not want the extra hassle of back or neck 
pain. Try to intersperse long sessions of typing with other tasks, such as reading, drawing, calculating,  thinking or doing research.
<p>
If you do not touch type, you should learn to do so for the sake of your neck as well as for 
productivity. 
There are several good software packages that teach touch typing interactively. If you use one for 
say 30 minutes a day for a couple of weeks, you will be able to touch type. By the time you 
finish the thesis, you will be able to touch type quickly and accurately and your six hour 
investment will have paid for itself. Be careful not to use the typing exercises as a displacement 
activity.
<p>
<dt>Exercise</dt>
<dd>Do not give up exercise for the interim. Lack of exercise makes you feel bad, and you do 
not need anything else making you feel bad while writing a thesis. 30-60 minutes of exercise per day 
is probably not time lost from your thesis: I find that if I do not get regular exercise, I sleep less 
soundly and longer. How about walking to work and home again? (Walk part of the way if your 
home is distant.) Many people opine that a walk helps them think, or clears the head. You may find 
that an occasional stroll improves your productivity.
<p>

<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Do not forget to eat, and make an effort to eat healthy food. You should not lose fitness or risk 
illness at this critical time. Exercise is good for keeping you appetite at a healthy level. I know that you have little 
time for cooking, but keep a supply of fresh fruit, vegetables and bread. It takes less time to make a 
sandwich than to go to the local fast food outlet, and you will feel better afterwards. 
<p>

<dt>Drugs</dt>
<dd>Thesis writers have a long tradition of using coffee as a stimulant and alcohol or marijuana as 
relaxants. (Use of alcohol and coffee is legal, use of marijuana is not.) Used in moderation, they do not seem to have ill 
effects on the quality of thesis produced. Excesses, however, are obviously counter-productive: 
several espressi and you will be buzzing too much to sit down and work; several drinks at night 
will slow you down next day.

<dt>Others</dt>
<dd>Other people will be sympathetic, but do not take them for granted. Spouses, lovers, family and 
friends should not be undervalued. Spend some time with them and, when you do, have a good time. 
Do not spend your time together complaining about your thesis: they already resent the thesis because 
it is keeping you away from them. If you can find another student writing a thesis, then you may find 
it therapeutic to complain to each other about advisers and difficulties. S/he need not be in the same 
discipline as you are.

<a name="coda"><h3>Coda</h3></a>
Keep going---you're nearly there! Most PhDs will admit that there were times when we thought about reasons for not finishing. But it would be crazy to give up at the writing stage, after years of work on the research, and it would be something to regret for a long time.<p>
Writing a thesis is tough work. One anonymous post doctoral researcher told me: "You should
tell everyone that it's going to be unpleasant, that it will mess up their lives, that they will have to
give up their friends and their social lives for a while. It's a tough period for 
almost every student."
She's right: it is certainly hard work, it will probably be stressful and you will have to adapt 
your rhythm to it. It is also an important rite of passage and the satisfaction you will feel afterwards is wonderful. On behalf of scholars everywhere,
I wish you good luck!

<a name="structure"><h2>A suggested thesis structure </h2></a>

The list of contents and chapter headings below is appropriate for some theses. In some cases, one or 
two of them may be irrelevant. Results and Discussion are usually combined in several chapters of a 
thesis. Think about the plan of chapters and decide what is best to report your work. Then make a 
list, in point form, of what will go in each chapter. Try to make this rather detailed, so that you end 
up with a list of points that corresponds to subsections or even to the paragraphs of your thesis. At 
this stage, think hard about the logic of the presentation: within chapters, it is often possible to 
present the ideas in different order, and not all arrangements will be equally easy to follow. If you 
make a plan of each chapter and section before you sit down to write, the result will probably be 
clearer and easier to read. It will also be easier to write.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Copyright waiver</b></dt>
<dd> Your institution may have a form for this (UNSW does). In any case, this standard page gives the university 
library the right to publish the work, possibly by microfilm or some other medium. (At UNSW, the Postgraduate Student Office 
will give you a thesis pack with various guide-lines and rules about thesis format. Make sure 
that you consult that for its formal requirements, as well as this rather informal guide.)
<p>

<dt><b>Declaration</b></dt>
<dd> Check the wording required by your institution, and whether there is a standard form. Many universities require something 
like: "I hereby 
declare that this submission is my own work and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, 
it contains no material previously published or written by another person nor material which to 
a substantial extent has been accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma of the 
university or other institute of higher learning, except where due acknowledgment has been 
made in the text. (signature/name/date)"
<p>

<dt><b>Title page</b></dt>
<dd>This may vary among institutions, but as an example:
Title/author/"A thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the 
Faculty of Science/The University of New South Wales"/date.
<p>

<dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
<dd>Of all your thesis, this part will be the most widely published and most read because it 
will be published in Dissertation Abstracts International. It is best written towards the end, but 
not at the very last minute because you will probably need several drafts. It should be a 
distillation of the thesis: a concise description of the problem(s) addressed, your method of 
solving it/them, your results and conclusions. An abstract must be self-contained. Usually they 
do not contain references. When a reference is necessary, its details should be included in the 
text of the abstract. Check the word limit.
<p>

<dt><b>Acknowledgments</b></dt>
<dd>Most thesis authors put in a page of thanks to those who have helped them 
in matters scientific, and also indirectly by providing such essentials as food, education, genes,
money, help, advice, friendship etc. <i>If any of your work is collaborative, you should make it 
quite clear who did which sections.</i>
<p>

<dt><b>Table of contents</b></dt>
<dd>The introduction starts on page 1, the earlier pages should have roman numerals. It 
helps to have the subheadings of each chapter, as well as the chapter titles. Remember that the 
thesis may be used as a reference in the lab, so it helps to be able to find things easily.
<p>

<dt><b>Introduction</b></dt>
<dd>What is the topic and why is it important? State the problem(s) as simply as you can. 
Remember that you have been working on this project for a few years, so you will be very 
close to it. Try to step back mentally and take a broader view of the problem. How does it fit 
into the broader world of your discipline?
<p>

Especially in the introduction, do not overestimate the reader's familiarity with your topic. You 
are writing for researchers in the general area, but not all of them need be specialists in your particular topic. It may help to imagine such a person---think of some researcher whom you 
might have met at a conference for your subject, but who was working in a different area. S/he 
is intelligent, has the same general background, but knows little of the literature or tricks that 
apply to your particular topic.
<p>

The introduction should be interesting. If you bore the reader here, then you are unlikely to 
revive his/her interest in the materials and methods section. For the first paragraph or two, 
tradition permits prose that is less dry than the scientific norm. If want to wax lyrical about 
your topic, here is the place to do it. Try to make the reader want to read the kilogram of A4 
that has arrived uninvited on his/her desk. Go to the library and read several thesis 
introductions. Did any make you want to read on? Which ones were boring?
<p>

This section might go through several drafts to make it read well and logically, while keeping it 
short. For this section, I think that it is a good idea to ask someone who is not a specialist to 
read it and to comment. Is it an adequate introduction? Is it easy to follow?
There is an argument for writing this section---or least making a major revision of it---towards 
the end of the thesis writing. Your introduction should tell where the thesis is going, and this 
may become clearer during the writing.
<p>

<dt><b>Literature review</b></dt>
<dd>Where did the problem come from? What is already known about this problem? 
What other methods have been tried to solve it? 
<p>

        Ideally, you will already have much of the hard work done, if you have been keeping up with 
the literature as you vowed to do three years ago, and if you have made notes about important 
papers over the years. If you have summarised those papers, then you have some good starting 
points for the review.
<p>

<font size= -1>If you didn't keep your literature notes up to date, you can still do something useful: pass on the following advice to any beginning PhD students in your lab and tell them how useful this would have been to you. When you start reading about a topic, you should open a spread sheet file, or at least a word processor file, for your literature review. Of course you write down the title, authors, year, volume and pages. But you also write a summary (anything from a couple of sentences to a couple of pages, depending on the relevance). In other columns of the spread sheet, you can add key words (your own and theirs) and comments about its importance, relevance to you and its quality.</font><p>

        How many papers? How relevant do they have to be before you include them? Well, that is a 
matter of judgement. On the order of a hundred is reasonable, but it will depend on the field. 
You are the world expert on the (narrow) topic of your thesis: you must demonstrate this.
<p>

        A political point: make sure that you do not omit relevant papers by researchers who are like to be your examiners, or by 
potential employers to whom you might be sending the thesis in the next year or two.<p>



<dt><h3>Middle chapters</h3></dt>
<dd>    In some theses, the middle chapters are the journal articles of which the student was major 
author. There are several disadvantages to this format.
<p>

        One is that a thesis is both allowed and expected to have more detail than a journal article. For 
journal articles, one usually has to reduce the number of figures. In many cases, all of the 
interesting and relevant data can go in the thesis, and not just those which appeared in the 
journal. The degree of experimental detail is usually greater in a thesis. Relatively often a 
researcher requests a thesis in order to obtain more detail about how a study was performed.
<p>

        Another disadvantage is that your journal articles may have some common material in the 
introduction and the "Materials and Methods" sections.
<p>

        The exact structure in the middle chapters will vary among theses. In some theses, it is 
necessary to establish some theory, to describe the experimental techniques, then to report what 
was done on several different problems or different stages of the problem, and then finally to 
present a model or a new theory based on the new work. For such a thesis, the chapter 
headings might be: Theory, Materials and Methods, {first problem}, {second 
problem}, 
{third problem}, {proposed theory/model} and then the conclusion chapter. For other theses, 
it might be appropriate to discuss different techniques in different chapters, rather than to have a 
single Materials and Methods chapter.
<p>

        Here follow some comments on the elements Materials and Methods, Theory, Results and 
discussion which may or may not correspond to thesis chapters.
<p>

<dt>Materials and Methods</dt>
<dd> This varies enormously from thesis to thesis, and may be absent in 
theoretical theses. It should be possible for a competent researcher to reproduce exactly what you 
have done by following your description. There is a good chance that this test will be applied: 
sometime after you have left, another researcher will want to do a similar experiment either with 
your gear, or on a new set-up in a foreign country. Please write for the benefit of that 
researcher.
<p>

        In some theses, particularly multi-disciplinary or developmental ones, there may be more than 
one such chapter. In this case, the different disciplines should be indicated in the chapter titles.
<p>

<dt>Theory</dt>
<dd>When you are reporting theoretical work that is not original, you will usually need to 
include sufficient material to allow the reader to understand the arguments used and their 
physical bases. Sometimes you will be able to present the theory <i>ab initio,</i> but you should not 
reproduce two pages of algebra that the reader could find in a standard text. Do not include 
theory that you are not going to relate to the work you have done.
<p>

        When writing this section, concentrate at least as much on the physical arguments as on the 
equations. What do the equations mean? What are the important cases?
<p>

        When you are reporting your own theoretical work, you must include rather more detail, but 
you should consider moving lengthy derivations to appendices. Think too about the order and 
style of presentation: the order in which you did the work may not be the clearest 
presentation. 

<p>
Suspense is not necessary in reporting science: you should tell the reader where you are going 
before you start.
<p>

<dt>Results and discussion</dt>
<dd>The results and discussion are very often combined in theses. This is 
sensible because of the length of a thesis: you may have several chapters of results and, if you 
wait till they are all presented before you begin discussion, the reader may have difficulty 
remembering what you are talking about. The division of Results and Discussion material into 
chapters is usually best done according to subject matter. 
<p>

        Make sure that you have described the conditions which obtained for each set of results. What 
was held constant? What were the other relevant parameters? Make sure too that you have used 
appropriate statistical analyses. Where applicable, show measurement errors and standard 
errors on the graphs. Use appropriate statistical tests. 
<p>

	Take care plotting graphs. The origin and intercepts are often important so, unless the 
ranges of your data make it impractical, the zeros of one or both scales should usually appear on the 
graph. You should show error bars on the data, unless the errors are very small. For single measurements,
the bars should be your best estimate of the experimental errors in each coordinate. For multiple 
measurements these should include the standard error in the data.
The errors in different 
data are often different, so, where this is the case, regressions and fits should be weighted (i.e. 
they should minimize the sum of squares of the differences weighted inversely as the size of 
the errors.) (A common failing in many simple software packages that draw graphs 
and do regressions is that they do not treat errors adequately. UNSW student Mike Johnston has written a 
<a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/3rdyearlab/graphing/graph.html"> plotting  
routine</a> that plots data with error bars and performs weighted least square regressions. It is at 
http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/3rdyearlab/graphing/graph.html). You can just 'paste' your data into the input and it generates a .ps file of the graph.
<p>

        In most cases, your results need discussion. What do they mean? How do they fit into the 
existing body of knowledge? Are they consistent with current theories? Do they give new 
insights? Do they suggest new theories or mechanisms?
<p>

        Try to distance yourself from your usual perspective and look at your work. Do not just ask 
yourself what it means in terms of the orthodoxy of your own research group, but also how 
other people in the field might see it. Does it have any implications that do not relate to the 
questions that you set out to answer?<p>

<dt><h3>Final chapter, references and appendices</h3></dt>

<dt><b>Conclusions and suggestions for further work</b></dt>
<dd> Your abstract should include your 
conclusions in very brief form, because it  must also include some other material. A summary 
of conclusions is usually longer than the final section of the abstract, and you have the space to 
be more explicit and more careful with qualifications. You might find it helpful to put your 
conclusions in point form.
<p>

        It is often the case with scientific investigations that more questions than answers are produced. 
Does your work suggest any interesting further avenues? Are there ways in which your work 
could be improved by future workers? What are the practical implications of your work?
<p>

        This chapter should usually be reasonably short---a few pages perhaps. As with the 
introduction, I think that it is a good idea to ask someone who is not a specialist to read this 
section and to comment.
<p>

<dt><b>References (See also under literature review)</b></dt>
<dd> It is tempting to omit the titles of the articles cited, 
and the university allows this, but think of all the times when you have seen a reference in a 
paper and gone to look it up only to find that it was not helpful after all.
<p>
Should you reference web sites and, if so, how? If you cite a journal article or book, the reader can go to a library and check that the cited document and check whether or not it says what you say it did. A web site may disappear, and it may have been updated or changed completely. So references to the web are usually less satisfactory. Nevertheless, there are some very useful and authoritative sources. So, <i>if the rules of your institution permit it</i>, it may be appropriate to cite web sites. (Be cautious, and don't overuse such citations. In particular, don't use a web citation where you could reasonably use a "hard" citation. Remember that your examiners are likely to be older and more conservative.) You should give the URL and also the date you downloaded it. If there is a date on the site itself (last updated on .....) you should included that, too.

<dt><b>Appendices</b></dt>
<dd>If there is material that should be in the thesis but which would break up the flow or 
bore the reader unbearably, include it as an appendix. Some things which are typically included 
in appendices are: important and original computer programs, data files that are too large to be 
represented simply in the results chapters, pictures or diagrams of results which are not 
important enough to keep in the main text.

<b>A FAQ and some observations about the web</b><br>
Why and how did I write this document? The need for it was evident so, as one of my PhD students approached the end of his project, I made notes of everything that I said to him about thesis writing. These notes became the plan for the first draft of this document, which has been extended several times since then. I am surprised that it has hundreds of readers each day. However, this is an important message about the web. It takes time and thought to make a good resource but, if you do, it can benefit a lot of people. When this document was first posted, the web was relatively new and feedback showed that people were often surprised to find what they sought. Now there is a tendency to take the web for granted: one is almost disappointed not to find what one is seeking. However, the web is only as good as the collective effort of all of us. The readers of this document will be scholars, experts and educators: among the many contributions you will make to knowledge and your communities, there may be contributions that should be made freely available, all over the world. Keep this observation about the web in the back of your mind for <i>later,</i> when you are not writing a thesis.
