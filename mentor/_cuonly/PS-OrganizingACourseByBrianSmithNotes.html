These notes are a supplement to the slides which were used
during the seminar and record a few extra points brought up during the
seminar.


<p>
<h4> Knowledge </h4>

<p> A person acquires three different levels of knowledge about a
subject:

<ul>
<li> <b>Rote Knowledge</b>:
	Rote knowledge entails having a  basic understanding of the 
	overall structure of a subject.  This knowledge is superficial
	and deemphasizes details.  A student with rote knowledge of
	the area has some intuitive understanding of the subject but
	few tools with which they can solve concrete problems.
</li>

<li> <b>Application Knowledge</b>:
	Application knowledge is deeper than rote knowledge.  Students
	with application knowledge can solve concrete problems given
	to them that pertain to the subject area.  To attain application
	knowledge some amount of formalization of the subject is
	required.
</li>

<li> <b>Correlation Knowledge</b>:
	Correlation knowledge is the deepest form of knowledge.  Given
	a problem, the student is able to identify a technique that
	might be used to solve the problem and then proceed to apply
	the technique.  This knowledge requires deep intuition on
	the subject and is consequently the most difficult to teach
	or acquire.
</li>
</ul>

<p> Regardless of the type of knowledge you are trying to convey in
a course, the students need to know what is expected of them.  At the
beginning of each lecture, briefly state a few goals so the students
know where you are going.  Tell them you only require superficial knowledge
of the day's topics when you are trying to convey rote knowledge.  Or,
when appropriate, tell them they need to reread the day's lecture notes
and do several examples if you are trying to teach application or correlation
knowledge.

<p>
<h4>Designing Lectures</h4>

<p>
Theft was the primary recommendation here.  Pilfer, steal, pickpocket, filch,
and purloin other people's ideas, notes, and materials.  The more
sources the better.  Talk to friends, colleagues, and those who
have taught the course before.

<p>
Some advice on eye contact: Identify three or four people who are
paying attention in different parts of the room.  Rotate your eyes
from one to the next.  This should give the illusion of scanning the
entire class and focuses your attention on different parts of the
room.  (If you are really worried about students falling asleep,
distribute <b>chocolate-covered coffee beans</b>.)

<p> When considering the level or goals of your teaching, Brian
suggests that you "Teach to the middle of the class". The class can be
divided into three segments:

<ul>
<li> The students who will fail despite your greatest efforts.</li>
<li> The students who will succeed despite your greatest efforts.</li>
<li> Everyone else. </li>
</ul>

Focus your attention on this last group - they are the ones you can have
the most influence on.

When trying to motivate students, attempt to instill a love of the 
knowledge and subject area you are teaching. Be honest about the fact that
some things can be dry, but help them want to learn more. 

<h4>Lecture Notes</h4>

<p>
We had a bit of debate about lecture notes.  On one hand, if students
know that handouts of the day's lecture are readily available, there
is considerable temptation to skip class and pick up the notes later.
Furthermore, students tend to glaze over when you get to big equations
or other more complicated material if they have it already written out
for them.  Taking notes keeps them awake.  On the other hand, some
students find that if forced to scribble notes for the entire
period, that is all that they do, ending up with a set of notes but
having missed the lecture.  As a compromise between these extremes,
consider giving out incomplete notes.  At points during the lecture,
students may have to fill in sections, or answer little problems.

<h4>Tests and Cheating</h4>
There was an even longer debate about tests and cheating.  Some of the
most important points about tests that were touched on:

<ul>
<li> Some things such as design, planning, cooperation, group skills cannot
	be measured on a test.</li>
<li> Tests are "noisy."  Mood, amount of sleep, and breakfast cereal may all
	affect a student's performance on a test on any given day.</li>
<li> Given these problems with tests, they can still be important.  Students
	collaborate on homework so you don't know which answers are whose.
	Policies which strictly prohibit collaboration will not be 
	completely effective and may not be best for the educational
	process (students can learn a lot from working together).  Thus,
	while giving homework helps students learn, it may not be an
	effective evaluation technique.  Tests are more controlled.</li>
</ul>

A debate also ensued about methods for handling cheating:

<ul>
<li> The most important advice was to state your policy in the initial handout
	and repeat it in the first class.  Make sure there is no ambiguity.
</li>
<li> Find out what the policy for cheating is at your school.  It is different
	at every school.  Know your rights as a teacher and the students'
	rights.
</li>
<li> Since the process of prosecuting someone for cheating may be long and
	involved, it may be completely infeasible for you to try and
	prosecute every minor cheating case.  Brian takes the approach
	of "legislating" cheating away.  By making homework worth little,
	it is not worth the student's while to cheat and if they do
	anyway, you do not have to feel bound to prosecute because it
	makes little difference in their final grade.
</li>
<li> Keshav proposed a karmic view of cheating.  Let them cheat, you can't
	stop them anyway.  They are the ones who will end up losing in the end.
	Some pointed out, however, that this can devalue the grades for the 
	entire class, and more generally, lower the quality of the 
	university. There did not seem to be consensus on the best approach
	to handling cheating. 
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Teaching Tools</h4>

<p>
Finally, Brian mentioned a few tools you can use in your courses.  The
first is a new program from Addison-Wesley called "Custom Books".
Apparently, you can name chapters from a variety of books that they
publish and give them some notes of your own and Addison-Wesley will
bind them all up in a text for your class.  Addison-Wesley needs to
sell some minimum number of texts so it won't work for a small class
but if your class is upwards of 100 or 150, you could look into it.  A
second tool is called CoNotes.  This is a system for annotating
documents on the web.  For example, you can put an assignment up on
the web and one student can post a question about it (which is laid
out beside the text of the assignment in the appropriate place) and
can be answered by another student. This can serve as a useful reference
if you teach the same course again at a later time.
