Halpern spoke informally on his experience doing research in industry
from 1982-1996. During that time he was working at IBM as a research 
staff member and also as a consulting professor at Stanford, during 
which time he had graduate students. He described those years at 
IBM as a "research paradise." He was involved in one of the top theory
groups at the time and was surrounded by many very prominent researchers
in the area. Essentially, he says, they were allowed to do what they
wanted. There were very few constraints. He worked from home roughly 
twice a week, supervised graduate students and occasionally taught a 
graduate course. In comparison to academic life, he said that he 
wrote papers, went to conferences, and did research, but wasn't 
compelled to teach or to write grant proposals. 
<p> 

The theory group at IBM served multiple purposes. For the company, 
having a top research group serves as a kind of status symbol. 
Moreover, it can also be a great resource internally. For example, 
sometimes the right answer from one of the research groups will save
a company on the order of millions of dollars. Of course, there is always
the hope that some of the researchers will become interested in practical 
problems relating to products. Recently, Halpern claims that this has 
actually become more of a requirement. IBM, for example, still claims to 
support basic research, but when hiring will also ask questions about 
how you will fit in and interact with the more practically-oriented 
groups, and what impact your research may have on products. This shift 
seems to be occurring in many companies, with Microsoft being a 
counter-example. (They seem currently to be very interested in having 
a solid theory group, and have also invested in other research areas 
as well.) In general, the last four or five years has seen a change in 
how companies such as IBM view research. They seem to be asking for 
tighter connections between research and development. At IBM, many
researchers themselves will do a lot of coding. Halpern suggested that
this was not a good use of researchers' time. Zippel noted that it's 
easy for researchers to lose track of the system, and that therefore 
requiring that they write some of the code is not necessarily a bad 
thing. In short, if you work in industry, you will have to write code. 
<p> 

There are obviously tradeoffs between work in industry and work 
in academia. At a university, a lot of time will be spent on teaching, 
committee work, writing grant proposals and dealing with undergrads. On the 
other hand, in industry the focus may be more product rather than 
research oriented and a fair amount of travel may be required. When asked
about the job market, it was noted that research labs are hiring, but that
they are more and more focused on having direct connections to the 
company's products. It's not necessarily true that the research coming 
out of such labs is "worse" than academic research. Cornell regularly 
looks at research labs to try to lure people to academia. 
<p> 

Zippel's perspective was that rather than view research in industry as
a better or worse version of research in academia, that it should be
seen as simply another possible career path. Working in industry
arguably can give you a better chance to do work that will have a
direct impact on society. In fact, it's possible to work for a
company, not in a research lab, and still do research, albeit research
that is not traditionally done in a university setting. Lotus Notes is
an example of something produced from such an environment. The
possible downside is that it is not easy to get back into academia
from a position like that.
<p>

One distinction between academia and industry is in how funding is
acquired. More specifically, the audience in academia is usually other
academics. In industry, instead of convincing one's colleagues that an
idea is worth pursuing, it is necessary to convince bankers, venture
capitalists and consumers. This will of necessity require a different
sort of argument than when writing a proposal to NSF, for
example. Consequently, one will end up evaluating ideas differently,
usually with an eye toward whether an idea will contribute to
something good for society and/or increase the GNP. On the other hand,
the NSF, for example, is becoming more and more concerned with
"returns to society", both intellectual <em> and </em> financial, and
thus this difference between academia, industrial research labs and
advanced development groups is becoming blurred. Another distinction
is the time-frame allotted, that is, in academia tangible
returns/results are not expected immediately, but in some areas of
industry the window may be as short as three to six months.
<p> 

On another note, in industry it is 
often necessary to understand what's "good enough." That is, if some
module in the system is just written horribly, it may be necessary 
to step back and say it's ok to let that go, that there are other more 
pressing things to spend time on. The tempo in industry is "absolutely
breakneck." The goal being to get good ideas out onto the market first 
and best. It's essential when working in industry to always be aware 
of what the current state of the art is and what the hot problems are. 
In some cases, a hot problem today may not be so important in a couple of
years, and deciding where and what to spend time on is crucial.
