<p>A computer science graduate school survival guide, intended for prospective
or novice graduate students. This guide describes what I wish I had known
at the start of graduate school but had to learn the hard way instead.
It focuses on mental toughness and the skills a graduate student needs.
The guide also discusses finding a job after completing the Ph.D. and points

<p><b>Introduction</b>
</p><ul><i>"To know the road ahead, ask those coming back."</i>
<br>- Chinese proverb
<p>In February 1995, on a beautiful sunny day with clear Carolina blue
skies, I turned in the final, signed copy of my dissertation. The graduate
school staff member did some last-minute checks on the document and pronounced
it acceptable. After six and a half years of toil and sweat, I was finally
done! While walking back to the C.S. department building, I was sorely
disappointed that the heavens didn't part, with trumpet-playing angels
descending to announce this monumental occasion. Upon hearing this observation,
<a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/%7Ebrooks/">Dr.
Fred Brooks</a> (one of my committee members) commented, "And the sad fact
is, you're no smarter today than you were yesterday." "That's true," I
replied, "but the important thing is that I am smarter than I was six and
a half years ago."
</p><p>That day was over two years ago, and since then I have had plenty of
time to reflect upon my graduate student career. One thought that has repeatedly
struck me is how much easier graduate school might have been if somehow,
magically, some of the things I knew when I turned in my dissertation I
could have known when I first entered graduate school. Instead, I had to
learn those the hard way. Of course, for many topics this is impossible:
the point of graduate school is to learn those by going through the experience.
However, I believe other lessons can be taught ahead of time. Unfortunately,
such guidance is rarely offered. While I had to learn everything the hard
way, new graduate students might benefit from my experiences and what I
learned. That is the purpose of this guide.
</p><p>Very little of this guide discusses technical matters. Technical skills,
intelligence and creativity are certainly strong factors for success in
graduate school. For example, I doubt there is a C.S. graduate student
who didn't at one point wish he or she had a stronger mathematical background.
However, it's beyond the scope of this guide to tell you how to be technically
brilliant, as the following joke implies:
<br>&nbsp;
</p><ul><i>The Feynman Problem Solving Algorithm:</i>
<br>1) Write down the problem.
<br>2) Think very hard.
<br>3) Write down the solution.</ul>
You don't have to be a genius to do well in graduate school. You must be
reasonably intelligent, but after a certain point, I think other traits
become more important in determining success.
<p>This guide covers the character traits and social skills that often
separate the "star" graduate students from the ordinary ones. Who are the
students who are self-motivated, take initiative, find ways around obstacles,
communicate well both orally and in writing, and get along well enough
with their committee and other department members to marshal resources
to their cause? Which students seem to know "how the system works" and
manage to get things done? These traits are hardly unique to succeeding
in graduate school; they are the same ones vital to success in academic
or industrial careers, which is probably why many of the best graduate
students that I knew were ones who had spent some time working before they
came back to school.
</p><p>This document is aimed at junior C.S. graduate students, but these observations
are probably broad enough to apply to graduate education in other technical
fields. My conclusions are certainly colored by my particular experiences
(doing my dissertation work in interactive computer graphics in the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/">Computer
Science department of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>)
but I think they are fairly general in application and should be of interest
to readers at other schools and other C.S. specialties. Obviously, these
are only my opinions and may not represent the views of other sane individuals
or organizations. Some points may be controversial, but if they weren't
this would not be interesting reading. Parts of this document come from
two informal talks I gave at UNC about "the Ph.D. job hunt" and "observations
from spending one year in industrial research." Both talks had larger audiences
than any informal <i>technical</i> talk I gave at UNC, which told me that
students are definitely interested in these subjects!</p></ul>

<p><br><b>Why get a Ph.D.?</b>
</p><ul><i>"Being a graduate student is like becoming all of the Seven Dwarves.
In the beginning you're Dopey and Bashful. In the middle, you are usually
sick (Sneezy), tired (Sleepy), and irritable (Grumpy). But at the end,
they call you Doc, and then you're Happy."</i>
<br>- yours truly
<p>The most basic question every Ph.D. student must know the answer to
is: "Why the hell am I doing this?"
</p><p>It's a good question. The hours are long. The pay is low, with minimal
benefits. After graduation, Ph.D. salaries are higher than B.S. and M.S.
salaries, but the difference doesn't make up for the income lost by staying
in school longer. The M.S. has a better "bucks for the time invested" ratio
than the Ph.D. does. And in terms of social status, a graduate student
doesn't rank very high on the ladder.
</p><p>If you do not have an acceptable answer to this question, then don't
get a Ph.D. I repeat: if you do not have a rock-solid reason for getting
the Ph.D., then it is better that you leave with a Master's.
</p><p>Why? Completing a Ph.D. is a long, hard road with many potholes and
washed out bridges along the way. You may run over some land mines and
have to stop and turn around and explore other routes. If the goal is important
enough to you, then these obstacles will not prevent you from completing
your journey. But if you don't know why you are on this road, then you
will get discouraged and will probably leave without finishing, having
wasted years of your life.
</p><p>I faced this situation after the first time I took the Doctoral Written
Exam (which at the time was the entrance examination into the Ph.D. program).
I missed passing it by just 4 percentage points. I then had to decide whether
or not to try again next semester (committing myself again to spending
weeks getting ready for the test) or just leave with an M.S. degree.
</p><p>I didn't come to graduate school with the Ph.D. as the primary goal.
So this test result forced me to answer the basic question "Why the hell
am I doing this?" After much soul searching, I found my answer and decided
to take the test again, passed it, and went on to get my Ph.D.
</p><p>I got the Ph.D. because I wanted to get a research position after leaving
graduate school. I wanted to work with the state of the art and extend
it. I did not want to "bring yesterday's technology one step closer to
tomorrow." I wanted a job that would I find interesting, challenging and
stimulating. While an M.S. would give me a chance at landing a research
position, the Ph.D. would give me a much better chance. And I did not want
to live with regrets. If I took the Doctoral Written Exam again and failed
again, then I could say that it wasn't meant to be and move on with my
life. I would have no regrets because I had given it my best shot and was
not able to make it. However, if I left with an M.S. without taking the
test a second time, and five years later I was in a job that was boring
and uninteresting, then I would have to lie awake every night for the rest
of my life wondering "What if?" What if I had taken the test again and
passed? Would I then be in the job that I really wanted? That was not a
situation I wanted to be in. I did not want to live the rest of my life
regretting what might have been.
</p><p>In hindsight, I think one of the main reasons I successfully completed
the Ph.D. was the fact that I <i>didn't</i> pass the exam on the first
try. It's ironic, but life sometimes works in strange ways. That initial
failure caused me to answer the basic question, providing the mental fortitude
to keep going despite the hurdles and problems I would later face.
</p><p>My answer is you should get a Ph.D. if it is required for your goals
after graduate school, such as becoming a professor or a researcher in
academia, government or industry. Your answer may differ from mine. As
long as you have an answer that you believe in passionately, then that's
enough. If you don't have an answer, then save yourself a lot of grief
and don't get the Ph.D.</p></ul>
<b>Academia is a business</b>
<ul><i>"Remember the Golden Rule: Those who have the gold make the rules."</i>
<p>Academia is a business, and "graduate student" is a job title. This
is especially true at private universities. Academia is very peculiar type
of business. It is certainly not the Real World and does not work in the
same way that the ordinary corporate world does. However, it is a business
nonetheless and as a graduate student, you must treat it that way. Graduate
school made a lot more sense and became much easier for me after I realized
this. If you think of graduate school as an "Ivory Tower" free of politics,
money problems, and real-world concerns, you are going to be severely disappointed.
If you don't believe me, read
<i>The Idea Factory</i> by Pepper White (listed
in the references) for one account of graduate life at MIT.
</p><p>A few graduate students are independently wealthy or have fellowship
and scholarship money that cover all their expenses for their total stay
in graduate school. Such students are rare, however. Most of us needed
financial support, in the form of Teaching Assistantships or Research Assistantships
(RA's). In general, RA's are more desirable to students since those can
directly fund the research you need to finish.
</p><p>Where does the money come from to fund RA's? Your professors have to
raise funds from external organizations. These include government agencies
such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and others.
Private companies also fund some university research, although this tends
to be less common, in smaller amounts, and in the form of equipment donations.
These organizations don't just give money away as charity. They expect
their money to accomplish something. Increasingly these days, this takes
the form of a contract for a working demonstration that must be shown at
the end. That means once the money is delivered, your professors must come
through with the working demonstration. It is rare that they do this by
themselves. Instead, they find some very capable, young, self-motivated
people who are willing to work long hours for small amounts of pay. In
other words, they fund RA's.
</p><p>The RA job is crucial to the academic business. If the RA's cannot successfully
conduct the research, then the demonstration will not work in the end and
the funding agencies may not be happy. They may choose not to fund your
professor in the future, which will bring his or her research program to
a halt. And there are many professors and other researchers chasing too
few research dollars these days; it is a competitive market. Thus, each
professor wants the best students available. These students are the most
capable ones who can get the research done required to fulfill the funding
contracts.
</p><p>That means you must treat an RA like a job. You must prove to your professors
that you are capable of getting the work done, being a team player, communicating
your results, and most of the other characteristics needed to do well in
regular jobs. That's why many of the upcoming sections in this guide sound
like ones written for the regular workplace.
</p><p>What do you get out of this? At the start, you may have to do tasks
specifically related to the funding contracts. But eventually your professor
must be flexible enough to fund your own specific research program that
leads to the completion of your dissertation. Your stipend and tuition
waiver should be enough to live on frugally without going into debt. You
will learn the state of the art in your chosen speciality and conduct cutting-edge
research on a subject that you find interesting and enjoyable. If you don't
find this compensation sufficient, then you shouldn't be in graduate school
in the first place.
</p><p>The bottom line: realize that academia is a peculiar kind of business
and the role you play in this enterprise. If you do your job well (and
have good negotiation and interpersonal skills, as discussed in future
sections), both your needs and your professors' needs will be met. But
don't enter an RA position thinking that the computers, research equipment,
staff members and other resources that you are provided with are your birthright.
Don't take them for granted! Most of those exist only because your professors
have been able to raise the money to provide those to you. In turn, you
must fulfill your end of the deal by doing great research with those resources.
If you don't do your job well, don't be surprised if your professors choose
not to fund you in the future. They do not <i>have</i> to provide you with
an RA job or let you use the computing equipment they acquired. And the
student who has no funding, no tuition reimbursement and no access to required
computing resources is the student who leaves the university that semester.
</p><p>How do you make sure you are one of those best, highly desired RA's?

<b>Graduate school is a different ballgame</b>
<ul><i>"Don't let school get in the way of your education."</i>
<br>- Mark Twain
<p><i>"The IQ test was invented to predict academic performance, nothing
else. If we wanted something that would predict life success, we'd have
to invent another test completely."</i>
<br>- Robert Zajonc
</p><p>If you go through a Ph.D. program, you will find graduate school a very
different world from undergraduate school. If you just get an M.S., then
graduate school may not be much different from undergrad (depending on
where you get your degree), except that the courses are deeper and more
advanced. But for a Ph.D. student, graduate school is a whole new ballgame.
The students who do well are the ones who learn this earlier rather than
later and make the necessary adjustments.
</p><p>Graduate school is not primarily about taking courses. You will take
classes in the beginning but in your later years you probably won't have
any classes. People judge a recently graduated Ph.D. by his or her research,
not by his or her class grades. And, without any offense to my professors,
most of what you learn in a Ph.D. program comes outside of classes: from
doing research on your own, attending conferences, and talking to your
fellow students. Success in graduate school does not come from completing
a set number of course units but rather from successfully completing a
research program.
</p><p>Graduate school is more like an apprenticeship where each student has
his or her own project, and the masters may or may not be particularly
helpful. It's like teaching swimming by tossing students into the deep
end of the pool and seeing who makes it to the other end alive and who
drowns. It's like training clock designers by locking students inside a
clock factory with some working clocks and lots of clock parts and machines
for building clocks. However, the instructions are at best incomplete and
even the masters themselves don't know exactly how to build next year's
models.
</p><p>Excelling in a Ph.D. program requires different skills than doing well
in undergrad. Undergraduate education tests you through class projects
(that do not last more than a semester), essays, midterms and finals. For
the most part, you work alone. Your professor may not know your name. Every
other student in your class takes the same tests or does similar projects.
But in a Ph.D. program, you must select and complete a unique long-term
research program. For most of us, this means you have to learn <i>how</i>
to do research and all that entails: working closely with your professors,
staff and fellow students, communicating results, finding your way around
obstacles, dealing with politics, etc.
</p><p>I'm not saying that tests and grades are completely unimportant in graduate
school. One of the two biggest hurdles in completing a Ph.D. is passing
the qualifying exam. (The other is finding an acceptable dissertation topic.)
But because graduate school is not nearly as exam-based as undergraduate
education and requires different skills, the GRE and undergraduate grades
are not as good an indicator of who will excel and who will drop out as
admission committees seem to think. Those tests do not measure creativity,
tenacity, interpersonal skills, oral presentation skills, and many other
important traits.
</p><p>The next several sections discuss these traits.
<br>&nbsp;</p></ul>
<b>Initiative</b>
<ul><i>"The difference between people who exercise initiative and those
who don't is literally the difference between night and day. I'm not talking
about a 25 to 50 percent difference in effectiveness; I'm talking about
a 5000-plus percent difference, particularly if they are smart, aware,
and sensitive to others."</i>
<br>- Stephen R. Covey, <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>
<p>The dissertation represents a focused, personal research effort where
you take the lead on your own, unique project. If you expect that your
adviser is going to hold your hands and tell you what to do every step
of the way, you are missing the point of the dissertation. Ph.D. students
must show initiative to successfully complete the dissertation. This does
not mean that guidance from professors is unimportant, just that this guidance
should be at a reasonably high level, not at a micromanaging level. If
you never do any tasks except those that your professor specifically tells
you to do, then you need to work on initiative.
</p><p>At UNC, there is a famous anecdote about a former UNC graduate student
named Joe Capowski. Many years ago, UNC got a force-feedback mechanical
arm to use with molecular visualization and docking experiments. The problem
was how to move it to UNC. This mechanical arm is a large, heavy beast,
and it was in Argonne National Labs in Chicago, IL. Unfortunately, there
was a trucker's strike going on at the time. Joe Capowski, on his own initiative
(and without telling anyone), flew out to Argonne, rented a car, drove
the mechanical arm all the way back to North Carolina, and then handed
the computer science department the bill! Many years later, Joe Capowski
ran for the Chapel Hill city council and won a seat. Prof. Fred Brooks
gave him an endorsement. I still remember the words Dr. Brooks said: "I
may not agree with his politics, but I know he'll get things done."
</p><p>While the Joe Capowski anecdote is perhaps a bit extreme, it does show
that it is often better to ask forgiveness than permission, provided you
are not becoming a "loose cannon." Certain universities (e.g. MIT) are
good at fostering a "can do" attitude among their graduate students, and
therefore they become more assertive and productive. One of the hallmarks
of a senior graduate student is that he or she knows the types of tasks
that require permission and those that don't. That knowledge will come
with experience. Generally, it's the senior graduate students who have
the most freedom to take initiative on projects. This privilege has to
be earned. The more that you have proven that you can work independently
and initiate and complete appropriate tasks, the more your professors will
leave you alone to do what you want to do.
<br>&nbsp;</p></ul>
<b>Tenacity</b>
<ul><i>"Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal. My strength
lies solely in my tenacity."</i>
<br>- Louis Pasteur
<p>You don't need to be a genius to earn a Ph.D. (although it doesn't hurt).
But nobody finishes a dissertation without being tenacious. A dissertation
usually takes a few years to complete. This can be a culture shock to former
undergraduates who have never worked on a project that lasted longer than
one quarter or semester (at the end of which, whatever the state of the
project, one declares victory and then goes home). No one can tell you
in advance exactly how long the dissertation will take, so it's hard to
see where the "end of the road" lies. You will encounter unexpected problems
and obstacles that can add months or years to the project. It's very easy
to become depressed and unmotivated about going on. If you are not tenacious
about working on the dissertation, you won't finish.
</p><p>Tenacity means sticking with things even when you get depressed or when
things aren't going well. For example, I did not enjoy my first year of
graduate school. I didn't tell anyone this until after leaving UNC. I was
not on a project and was focused on taking classes, some of which I didn't
do all that well in. I didn't feel a part of the Department, and really
wondered whether or not I fit in. Still, I stuck with it and when summer
rolled around and I got a job in the Department, I became much more involved
in research and enjoyed graduate school much more. Part of earning a Ph.D.
is building a "thick skin" so you are not so fragile that you will give
up at the first sign on any difficulties.
</p><p>One lesson I learned as a graduate student is the best way to finish
the dissertation is to do something every day that gets you closer to being
done. If all you have left is writing, then write part of the dissertation
<i>every
day</i>. If you still have research to do, then do part of it
<i>every
day</i>. Don't just do it when you are "in the mood" or feeling productive.
This level of discipline will keep you going through the good times and
the bad and will ensure that you finish.
<br>&nbsp;</p></ul>
<b>Flexibility</b>
<ul><i>"Back in graduate school, I'd learned how to survive without funding,
power, or even office space. Grad students are lowest in the academic hierarchy,
and so they have to squeeze resources from between the cracks. When you're
last on the list for telescope time, you make your observations by hanging
around the mountaintop, waiting for a slice of time between other observers.
When you need an electronic gizmo in the lab, you borrow it in the evening,
use it all night, and return it before anyone notices. I didn't learn much
about planetary physics, but weaseling came naturally."</i>
<br>- Clifford Stoll, <i>The Cuckoo's Egg</i>
<p><i>"The Chinese call luck opportunity and they say it knocks every day
on your door. Some people hear it; some do not. It's not enough to hear
opportunity knock. You must let him in, greet him, make friends and work
together."</i>
<br>- Bernard Gittelson
</p><p>Flexibility means taking advantage of opportunities and synergies, working
around problems, and being willing to change plans as required. As a graduate
student, you are on the bottom of the academic totem pole. Even undergraduates
can rank higher, especially at private universities (because they actually
pay tuition!) You cannot <i>order</i> anybody to do anything. In general,
you will be in the position of reacting to big events rather than controlling
them. Therefore, you must be flexible in your approach and research program.
</p><p>For example, you may not have as much access to a piece of laboratory
equipment as you would like, or maybe access is suddenly cut off due to
events beyond your control. What do you do? Can you find a replacement?
Or reduce the time needed on that equipment? Or come in at odd hours when
no normal person uses that equipment? Or redefine the direction of your
project so that equipment is no longer required?
</p><p>Events can be good as well as bad. The difference between the highly
effective graduate student and the average one is that the former recognizes
those opportunities and takes advantage of them. I had nothing to do with
bringing <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/%7Egb/">Gary Bishop</a> to UNC. But
after he arrived I realized my research would progress much faster if he
became my adviser so I made the switch and that was a big help to my graduate
student career. Opportunities for synergy and serendipity do occur, but
one has to be flexible enough to recognize them and take advantage of them.
<br>&nbsp;</p></ul>
<b>Interpersonal skills</b>
<ul><i>"For humans, honesty is a matter of degree. Engineers are always
honest in matters of technology and human relationships. That's why it's
a good idea to keep engineers away from customers, romantic interests,
and other people who can't handle the truth."</i>
<br>- Scott Adams, <i>The Dilbert Principle</i>
<p><i>"I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the
madness of people."</i>
<br>- Isaac Newton
</p><p>Computer Science majors are not, in general, known for their interpersonal
skills. Some of us got into this field because it is easier to understand
machines than people. As frustrating as computers can be, they at least
behave in a logical manner, while human beings often do not. However, your
success in graduate school and beyond depends a great deal upon your ability
to build and maintain interpersonal relationships with your adviser, your
committee, your research and support staff and your fellow students. This
does not mean you must become the "life of the party." I am not and never
will be a gregarious, extroverted person. But I did make a serious effort
to learn and practice interpersonal skills, and those were crucial to my
graduate student career and my current industrial research position.
</p><p>Why should this matter, you may ask? If one is technically brilliant,
shouldn't that be all that counts? The answer is no, because the situation
is different from your undergraduate days. In both graduate school and
in business, you must depend upon and work with other people to achieve
your goals To put this in perspective, I have excerpted the following from
an article called "Organizations: The Soft and Gushy Side" by Kerry J.
Patterson, published in Fall 1991 issue of <i>The Bent:</i>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><ul>I first learned of the capricious, human side of organizations some
15 years ago while studying the careers of engineers and scientists. The
research design required that I spend eight hours a day in one-on-one interviews.
For two hours I'd ask "career" questions of an engineer, chemist, physicist,
or applied mathematician -- all of whom worked for a Fortune 500 firm.
During these 120 minutes, the subjects talked about the perils of the organizations.
Two hours was scarcely enough time to share their stories. All energetically
discussed their personal careers. Most had been frustrated with the "soft
and gushy" side of organizations. Some had figured out the system and learned
to master it. Others had not.
<p>As part of the research design, we asked to talk to low, medium, and
high performers. This in itself was an interesting exercise. To determine
performance rankings, we would place in front of a senior manager the names
of the 10-50 people within his or her organization. Each name would be
typed neatly in the middle of a three-by-five card. After asking the manager
to rank the employees from top to bottom, the managers would then go through
a card sort. Typically the executive would sort the names into three or
four piles and then resort each pile again. Whatever the strategy, the
exercise usually took only minutes. Just like that, the individual in charge
of the professionals in question was able to rank, from top to bottom,
as many as 50 people. It rarely took more than three minutes and a couple
of head scratches and grunts. Three minutes. Although politics may appear
ambiguous to those on the receiving end, those at the top were able to
judge performance with crystal clarity.
</p><p>This performance ranking (conducted by individuals not involved in the
interviews) was then used as a dependent measure. Those of us conducting
the interviews attempted to surface information (independent measures)
that would predict the ranking. What about a scientist's career would lead
to a top ranking? What trashed a perfectly good career? Surely scientific
prowess would have an impact. And it did.
</p><p>But technological prowess wasn't as predictive as another factor. We
discovered that we could tell what performance group the interviewees belonged
to within a minute or two by their attitudes toward people and politics.
Individuals who were ranked low by their managers spoke of organizational
politics as if it were poison. They were exceptionally annoyed by the people
side of the business. They frequently stated they would rather be left
alone to conduct their research untrammeled by human emotions. They characterized
the social side of organizations as "soft and gushy." They sounded like
Spock turned bitter.
</p><p>Top performers, in contrast, found a way to work within the political
system. They hadn't exactly embraced politics. They didn't appear like
that toothy kid you knew back in college who lived to fight political battles.
They didn't come off as glad-handling sales folks. These were professional
scientists who were often top ranked in their field. They looked and talked
liked scientists. The difference between them and those ranked at the bottom
of the totem pole was clear. They had found a way to make peace with organizations,
people, and politics. They climbed to the top of their field by mastering
both hard things and soft and gushy people.
</p><p>Engineers and scientists aren't the only ones who find the human side
of the organizations to be annoying. As we expanded our research to include
professors, accountants, and other professionals, the findings were remarkably
similar. All found political machinations to be distasteful. It's just
that some had found a way to master the social aspects -- the top performers.
<br>&nbsp;</p></ul>
Students usually look down on politics, but politics in its most basic,
positive form is simply the art of getting things done. Politics is mostly
about who is allowed to do what and who gets the resources (money, people,
equipment, etc.) To succeed in your research, you will need resources,
both capital and personnel. Interpersonal skills are mandatory for acquiring
those resources. If you are incapable of working with certain people or
make them mad at you, you will not get those resources and will not complete
your research.
<p>For example, which group of people did I try my best to avoid offending?
Was it my committee? No, because healthy disagreements and negotiations
with your adviser and committee are crucial to graduating within a reasonable
amount of time. Nor was it my fellow students, because I did not need help
from most of them, and most of them did not need me. The critical group
was the <i>research and support staff</i>. These include the research faculty
and all the various support positions (the system administrators, network
administrators, audio-visual experts, electronic services, optical and
mechanical engineers, and especially the secretaries). <i>I needed their
help to get my research done, but they did not directly need me. </i>Consequently,
I made it a priority to establish and maintain good working relationships
with them.
</p><p>Cultivating interpersonal relationships is mostly about treating people
with respect and determining their different working styles. Give credit
where credit is due. Acknowledge and thank them for their help. Return
favors. Respect their expertise, advice and time. Apologize if you are
at fault. Realize that different people work in different ways and are
motivated by different things -- the more you understand this diversity,
the better you will be able to interact and motivate them to help you.
For certain people, offering to buy them dinner or giving them free basketball
tickets can work wonders.
</p><p>A true example: at one point in my research, I needed to make significant
modifications to some low-level code in the graphics computer called "Pixel
Planes 5." Doing this required expertise that I did not have, but another
graduate student named <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/%7Eolano/">Marc Olano</a>
did. How should I tap into Marc's expertise and get my necessary changes
done?
</p><p>The wrong way is to go up to Marc, explain the problem, and get him
to make the changes. Marc doesn't need the changes done; I do. Therefore,
I should do most of the work. Expecting him to do the work shows disrespect
of his time.
</p><p>What I actually did was to explain the problem to Marc and he sketched
out a possible solution. Then I ran off and worked on my own for a few
days, trying to implement the solution. I got part of it working, but ended
up getting stuck on another part. Only at that point did I go back to Marc
and ask him for help. By doing this, I showed that I respected his time
and wanted to minimize his burden, thus making him more willing to help
me. Months later, when he and <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/%7Ecohen/">Jon
Cohen </a>needed my help in setting up a system to demonstrate some of
their software, I was more than happy to return the favor.
</p><p>Interpersonal interaction is a huge subject and goes far beyond my description
here. All I can really do in this section is (hopefully) convince you that
these skills are vital to your graduate student career and encourage you
to learn more if you need to improve these skills. I still have a lot to
learn myself. I recommend reading <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>
and <i>Type Talk</i> (both listed in the References section) as starting
points.&nbsp; The magazine article "How to be a star engineer" (listed
in the References) also touches on this subject.
<br>&nbsp;</p></ul>
<b>Organizational skills</b>
<ul><i>"Failing to plan is planning to fail."</i>
<p>Since academia is a type of business, you will have responsibilities
that you must uphold. You will be asked to greet and talk with visitors,
give demos, show up to meetings, get projects done on time, etc. If you
are not well organized, you will have a difficult time meeting those obligations.
A technically brilliant student will be greatly hampered if he or she exhibits
an "absent minded" personality and develops a reputation for being disorganized.
</p><p>There are many different time management and organization skills, and
you can find many books on those at your local bookstore. This guide is
not going to describe them. Find one that works for you and use it. I can
highly recommend Stephen Covey's book, listed in the references. But whatever
system you pick, just make sure it works for you. I have never found anyone
else who uses my filing scheme, but it is effective for me (by minimizing
the combined time of putting away and locating a piece of information).
All that really matters is whether or not it works.
</p><p>One metaphor I found useful is the following: Organize your tasks as
if you were juggling them. Juggling several balls requires planning and
skill. You must grab and toss each ball before it hits the ground. You
can only toss one ball at a time, just as you can only work on one task
at a time. The order in which you toss the balls is crucial, much as the
order of working on tasks often determines whether or not you meet all
your deadlines. Finally, once you start a task (grab a ball) you want to
get enough done so you can ignore it for a while (throw it high enough
in the air so it won't come down for a while). Otherwise you waste too
much time in context switches between tasks. Do you see jugglers try to
keep each ball at the same height above the ground, frantically touching
every ball every second?
</p><p><a href="http://wonderland.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/randy.htm">Randy Pausch</a>
(a professor at CMU) has a <a href="http://wonderland.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/Randy/timetalk.htm">set
of notes on time management.</a> Three words in his guide summarize the
most vital step: Kill your television. He asks you to keep your priorities
straight. What is the most important thing to a Ph.D. student? It should
be finishing the dissertation, not watching every episode of <i>Friends</i>.
That doesn't mean dropping everything else in life, but it does mean knowing
what takes priority and allocating time accordingly.
<br>&nbsp;</p></ul>
<b>Communications skills</b>
<ul><i>"What is written without effort is, in general, read without pleasure."</i>
<br>- Samuel Johnson
<p><i>"Present to inform, not to impress; if you inform, you will impress.
"</i>
<br>- Fred Brooks
</p><p>I am always amazed that articles written about businesses consistently
put good communication skills at or near the top of list of skills that
employers want to see in people but rarely find. But you know what? It's
true!
</p><p>Communication skills, both written and oral, are vital for making a
good impression as a Ph.D. student and as a researcher. At a minimum, you
have to defend your dissertation with an oral presentation. But you should
also expect to write technical papers and reports, give presentations at
conferences, and give demonstrations to groups of visitors. If you can
write and speak well, you will earn recognition and distinguish yourself
from the other graduate students. This is especially true when giving presentations
in front of important visitors or at major conferences.
</p><p>Conversely, if you cannot communicate well, then your career options
after graduation will be limited.&nbsp; Professors spend most of their
time communicating: teaching, fundraising, guiding graduate students, and
documenting their results (through papers, videos, viewgraphs, etc.)&nbsp;
In industry, we need people who can communicate well so they can work in
teams, learn what businesses and customers need, present their results,
raise funds, and transition to leadership roles in projects and personnel
management.&nbsp; If you are technically brilliant but are incapable of
communicating, then your results will be limited to what you can accomplish
alone and your career growth will be limited, both in industry and academia.
</p><p>Unfortunately, not all graduate students receive training in giving
presentations or writing technical documents (which are different from
English essays). These are skills that can be learned! Don't worry if giving
presentations and writing papers are not something that comes naturally
to you. I was not very comfortable giving oral presentations when I started
graduate school, so I made a concerted effort to learn how to do so, by
taking classes, reading about the subject, and practicing. It's not easy,
but it's well worth the investment. If you need practice, try giving informal
talks at research luncheons, joining Toastmasters, and studying good speakers
to see what they do.
</p><p>Covering everything about this subject would fill a guide by itself
(check out the <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/publications/instructions/">SIGGRAPH
page on preparing and giving presentations</a>), and would probably better
done through a videotape than a written document. But here are a few basic
points:
<br>&nbsp;
</p><li>
Organization counts. Within the first few paragraphs or first few minutes,
tell me why I should read your paper or listen to your talk. Make it clear
where we are going and what we have already covered.</li>

<li>
Make the text in your slides large enough so that people sitting in the
back can read them. For large presentation halls, this usually means no
more than 6-7 lines per slide and 28 point type minimum. You'd be surprised
how many experts on visualization (especially tenured professors!) give
presentations with unreadable slides.</li>

<li>
Variety retains interest. Vary your pace, tone, and volume. Emphasize the
important points. Look around the room. Throw in some video, pictures,
or live examples.</li>

<li>
Don't stand in front of the screen and block everyone's view. You'd be
surprised how often people do this without realizing it.</li>

<li>
Point out the limitations of your work. That helps your credibility. Similarly,
give credit where credit is due.</li>

<li>
Make friends with the A/V crew! Running A/V is a thankless, negative reinforcement
job. If everything runs smoothly, well, that's what was supposed to happen
so nobody says anything. But if anything goes wrong, the entire audience
looks back at the control room. <i>Help the A/V people help you.
</i>Always
check in early and test the equipment. Tell them what you are going to
do in your presentation (e.g. I'm running 3 video segments). Make sure
you know how everything works long before you come up to the podium. And
thank the A/V crew for their help after you are done!</li>

<p><br>Confidence is the key to giving a good presentation. And the way
to gain confidence is to give good presentations. When you're just starting
out, this is a Catch-22. However, once you become good enough, this turns
into a positive feedback cycle that can make giving talks a pleasure.
</p><p>Writing papers and getting them published is vital for Ph.D. students
who want to get jobs in research after graduation. Your ability to write
well significantly improves the chances that your paper will be accepted.
When I was a young graduate student and read a paper that I didn't understand,
I thought "Gee, I must be dumb." Today I will read the same paper and think
"Boy, this is a lousy paper. The authors did not do a good job explaining
and presenting their work." If I am reviewing that paper, such a reaction
is enough for me to reject the paper.
</p><p>Where do you submit your papers? Your professors will help you with
this choice, but in general I would suggest shooting for the best conferences
or journals where you think it has a reasonable chance of being accepted.
It's not much more work to write, submit and present a paper in a highly
respected venue than in less respected venues. And if you don't shoot for
the top you'll never know if it would have made it. The field of computer
graphics is a bit unusual in that the most desirable place to publish is
a conference (<a href="http://www.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH</a>), rather
than a journal. Be aware that journals can take years to publish submitted
papers; the turn-around time is much faster in a conference.
</p><p>Finally, don't forget to communicate with your professors and your teammates.
Keep your committee appraised of your progress. One thing I do (which few
others do) is write short (1 screenfull) status reports, which I religiously
e-mailed to my professors and team members on a weekly basis. These serve
as an efficient way of keeping everyone up to date on what I'm doing. They
are also a good way for me to record my progress. If I need to remember
what I got done during a six month period, I have plenty of old status
reports that I can read. You'd be amazed how appreciative professors and
managers are of this simple practice. I also throw in a different humorous
quote at the end of each week's report to reward people for reading it.
</p><p>When you are working in the lab and you reach a milestone or achieve
a result, let people know about it! Bring in your professors and fellow
students and show it off! That's a win-win situation. It lets others know
that you are making progress and achieving results, and you get valuable
feedback and advice.
<br>&nbsp;</p></ul>
<b>Choosing an adviser and a committee</b>
<ul><i>"Some students in the lab are only nominally supervised by a thesis
advisor. This can work out well for people who are independent self-starters.
It has the advantage that you have only your own neuroses to deal with,
not your advisor's as well."</i>
<br>- from "How to do research at the MIT AI Lab"
<p>The choice of an appropriate adviser is crucial to successfully completing
the Ph.D. Your adviser must be someone who can cover your area of specialization
and someone you can get along with. When I started graduate school, I thought
the adviser - student relationship was supposed to be very close, both
professionally and socially. In reality, the relationship is whatever the
professor and the student choose to make of it. It can be close, with invited
dinners at the professor's home, or it can be distant, e.g. meeting once
per semester just to remind the professor that the student is still alive.
</p><p>One basic question in choosing an adviser is whether to pick a junior
(non-tenured) or a senior (tenured) professor. Non-tenured professors tend
to travel less and are generally more available. It is difficult to get
help from an adviser who is never in town. Non-tenured faculty have fewer
advisees that you have to compete with to get time with the professor.
They are more likely to be personally involved with your research -- writing
code, spending time in the lab at midnight, etc. Non-tenured faculty must
be energetic and hard working if they want to be awarded tenure, and this
work habit can rub off on their students. However, tenured faculty have
several advantages as well. They are usually the ones with most of the
money and resources to support you. They do not have to compete with their
students for publications and recognition. The advisee does not run the
risk of having his or her adviser not getting tenure and leaving the university.
Tenured faculty are more experienced with "how the game works" and thus
may be better sources of guidance, personal contacts, jobs after graduation,
etc.
</p><p>I ended up with a non-tenured professor (actually, he was not even on
the tenure track at the time) as my adviser, but also put several tenured
professors on my committee, including some of the most senior ones in my
specialty. In that way, I got the best of both worlds: the day-to-day attention
from the primary adviser, combined with the resources and experience of
the committee.
</p><p>Professors develop reputations amongst graduate students. Some are known
to graduate their Ph.D. students rapidly. Others are impossible to get
hold of, so their students take forever to finish or leave without graduating.
Some dictate what their advisees have to do, while others are accommodating
of student interests. Ask around. What you learn may be revealing. And
if circumstances change to make another professor a more appropriate match
to your needs, don't be afraid to switch if that is an overall win.
</p><p>When picking a committee, you want to make sure they can cover all the
areas of your thesis. You also want to make sure that it is likely that
all the committee members will be available for meetings! Including too
many professors who travel often will make it difficult to get all five
or six together in one room for a three hour oral exam or proposal meeting.
When scheduling such meetings, start by finding times when the difficult-to-reach
professors are in town, and then add in the other committee members.
<br>&nbsp;</p></ul>
<b>Balance and Perspective</b>
<ul><i>"Life goes by so fast, that if you don't stop and look around, you
might miss it."</i>
<br>- from the film <i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</i>
<p><i>"Generally speaking, people provide better maintenance for their
cars than for their own bodies."</i>
<br>- Scott Adams, <i>The Dilbert Future</i>
</p><p>When I was in graduate school, my top priority was crystal clear to
me: getting out with a Ph.D. Other people described me as "focused like
a laser beam" on that goal. In retrospect, I may have been too focused.
There <i>is</i> more to life than graduate work. Keeping your health and
your sanity intact are both vital to achieving the primary goal of getting
out.
</p><p>Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) is a major occupational hazard in our
industry. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is just one type of RSI. If you do not
know how to set up your workspace for good ergonomics, <i>learn now! </i>The
Pascarelli reference at the end of this guide is a good book on this subject.
Over a dozen of my friends and coworkers have been inflicted with this
problem. In severe cases, RSI can be a career-ending injury. If you can't
type, it's rather difficult to write papers, computer programs, presentations,
etc. Don't let this happen to you! Prevention is the way to go. Recently
I have been working with weights to strengthen my shoulders and wrists
as an additional preventative step.
</p><p>Earning a Ph.D. is like running a marathon. You have to learn to pace
yourself and take care of your body if you want to reach the finish line.
Unfortunately, students often act like sprinters running a marathon. They
are highly productive for a while, but then fall by the wayside because
they aren't eating correctly, exercising, taking time out to recharge their
batteries, etc. You maximize your long-term productivity by not ignoring
those other aspects. While I was in graduate school, I took time out to
travel up and down the East Coast, from Boston down to Orlando. That was
an important part of keeping my stress down and recharging my batteries.
I also did some running and circuit training for exercise. For shorter
breaks, I shot nerf basketballs at a tiny hoop mounted in the graphics
lab and kept a guitar in my office. Figure out what works for you.
</p><p>It's easy to lose perspective while in graduate school. You are surrounded
by so many other smart, hard working people that it is easy to feel inferior
and lose self-esteem and confidence. But without an underlying confidence
that you <i>do</i> have what it takes to complete a dissertation, it's
too easy to drop out when the going gets tough instead of sticking it through.
I found it useful to keep in touch with the "real world," to remind myself
that the graduate student population is not representative of humanity
in general and to keep my perspective. You got into graduate school because
you have already shown to your professors that you have potential and skills
that are not typical among most college students, let alone most people
-- don't forget that.
<br>&nbsp;</p></ul>
<b>The Ph.D. job hunt</b>
<ul><i>On rsums: "The closest to perfection a person ever
comes is when he fills out a job application form."</i>
<br>- Stanley Randall
<p><i>Real World, The (n.): Where a computer science student goes after
graduation; used pejoratively ("Poor slob, he got his degree and had to
go out into the REAL WORLD."). Among programmers, discussing someone in
residence there is not unlike talking about a deceased person."</i>
<br>- the fortune program
</p><p>Ideally, the job hunt begins years before you graduate. Networking is
very important: while you are in the middle to late phases of your graduate
studies, try to get yourself noticed by professors and industry people
<i>at
other sites</i>. One way to do this is to offer to give a talk about your
work at another site. This is not that difficult to do, since most research
places love to host seminars and bring in fresh ideas. Attending conferences
and working elsewhere during the summer are other ways to get exposure.
Make friends with graduate students and personnel at other schools. Make
and carry your own business cards. Schmooze with important visitors during
major site visits. For about two years, I ran the informal "Graphics Lunch"
symposia at UNC. That means I was the point of contact for many speakers
who visited UNC and that helped me make contacts. There is also a "star"
system that exists. Certain outstanding graduate students can get labeled
as "stars" by their professors and that can be an enormous help in getting
an interview at CMU or other prestigious locations. It's nice if you can
get on that track but one shouldn't rely upon it!
</p><p>Networking is important because many jobs are found and filled that
way. I got my position at<a href="http://www.hrl.com/"> HRL</a> partially
because I visited there, at my own expense, two years before I even started
my job hunt. That meant that when I circulated my rsum,
I was more than just a piece of paper to them. You are not going to be
looking for job ads in the newspaper. Instead, you'll look for announcements
in major journals, at conferences, on the Net, and through your contacts.
For industrial positions, it is crucial to get past the Human Resources
department and <i>find the individual with the ability to hire</i> and
deal with that person directly.
</p><p>When do you start asking for interviews? You can start when you are
able to give a talk about your dissertation work. Don't be too early or
too late, because you only get one chance per site. Academic positions
generally have a particular "season" (much like getting admitted to school)
that starts in the Fall and ends around April; industrial positions generally
don't follow that. The job hunt and interviewing process can take months;
factor that into your time allocation.
</p><p>The job supply and demand situation can vary dramatically in a few years,
and anything I say here about how strong the job market is today (Jan.
2003) will likely be out of date by the time you read it.&nbsp; For example,
during the time I was job hunting (end of 1994 to early 1995), good positions
were not easy to find. If I had a dollar for every site that told me "We
don't have a permanent position, but would you take a postdoc?" I could
buy a lot of lunches. However, around 1997 the graphics job market became
very strong, with many individuals getting multiple offers with high salaries.
1998 was an excellent year for people looking for tenure-track graphics
faculty positions. I know many friends who found good tenure-track positions
that year.&nbsp; So when I revised the guide in 2000, I said the job market
was strong with high demand. Of course, the tech industry went downhill
at that point and hasn't recovered yet. Now it is much more difficult to
find research positions in industry or academia.&nbsp; With luck, the market
will be much better at the time you read this.
</p><p>Before starting the job hunt, determine your goals and parameters in
advance and the "angle" you will take to sell yourself. For example, my
strength was in systems, so I chose to emphasize that in my cover letters.
Customize your approach to each site, if time permits. What you do for
your thesis determines who will and who won't take a look at you. Try to
get at least one reference from outside your university.
</p><p>This guide is not going to cover the basics of interviewing; you can
get that from many books (e.g. the Martin Yate and Bob Weinstein books
listed in the references). However, I will mention some tips. Don't interview
on the day of arrival, and try to avoid Mondays and Fridays. Be prepared
for hard or illegal questions, but you probably won't get them. <b>Do your
homework</b> on each site before interviewing! It continually amazes me
that people show up for interviews without knowing anything about the institution
they want to join. If the target is a research lab for a major company,
you can easily find Wall St. Journal articles, annual reports and stockbroker
reports in your library. If your goal is an academic position, check out
the <a href="http://learninglab.stanford.edu/projects/tomprof/newtomprof/index.shtml">Tomorrow's
Professor site</a> for guidance.&nbsp; If you interview at a university,
get their course catalog and <i>use their numbering scheme to describe
the courses you can teach</i>. Interview to find out more about them, not
just to sell yourself. Your 45-60 minute research presentation is crucial;
make sure you practice it thoroughly. <i>Interviews create interviews</i>.
That is, if you've already gone on many interviews at other places, then
that makes you appear more desirable since others want you, and that makes
it easier for you to get more interviews. Broadcast this fact by keeping
your interview schedule on your web page. There is an anecdote about one
student who received offers to interview at many different places, but
only after Stanford interviewed him! Keep logs on who you talk to, what
you talked about, and when. That makes it easier to keep things straight
when juggling several contenders. The major conferences in your field are
a good place to schedule preliminary interviews to get your foot in the
door, because it is cheap for the company or university. The people you
need to meet are already there, so that saves them the expense of having
to fly you out and house you at their site.
</p><p>Offers are a waiting game. Be prepared for lots of frustration. You
need a <i>written</i> offer or nothing is official; you should also accept
or reject in writing. Negotiate, but be aware of the strength or weakness
of your position. Starting salary may not be as important as the type of
work, benefits, and growth potential. Drug tests and other factors are
becoming more common; you will have to decide how you want to respond to
those.
</p><p>Ah yes, salaries. Everybody wants to know about those. For academic
(tenure track) salaries, you can get typical numbers from the annual Taulbee
surveys, printed in the Computing Research News newsletter and the Communications
of the ACM. Realize that these are 9-month salaries. Whether or not you
can procure funding that covers 2 or 3 months of summer salary makes a
big difference to your bottom line. Also, professors can make money by
consulting at rates of $1000-2500 per day, although this is more common
among established professors. Figures for industrial salaries are harder
to come by. The Maisel and Gaddy references are the only ones I have found
that specifically surveys young Ph.D.'s in industry (also see the chart
a few paragraphs down). Salaries depend heavily on geography. Silicon Valley
is in a league of its own, with salaries far above any other region. But
before you decide to move to Palo Alto, remember that the cost of living
there is also in the stratosphere. In Sept. 1997, a $60k salary in Indianapolis
bought the same standard of living as a $101k salary in San Jose! The cost
of living difference is larger today.&nbsp; Decent houses in the Silicon
Valley cost more than half a million.&nbsp; More general computer science
salary surveys are run by the IEEE and <a href="http://www.eet.com/">EE
Times</a>, available at the <a href="http://jobstar.org/">JobStar salary
survey site</a>.
</p><p>Acquire salary information on your own by making use of your network.
Don't ask for someone's salary directly, unless it's someone you know very
well and even then be very careful. Instead, bounce figures off people
and see how they respond. Do they think the figure you mention is high,
low, or about right? By seeing how people respond you can get an idea of
what the market range is.
</p><p>Factor in benefits and the expected workload into your compensation
evaluation. That $100k offer may seem less attractive if you have to work
80 hour weeks in that position.&nbsp; Traditionally, stock options made
up a large fraction of the compensation packages for startups and Silicon
Valley positions, but with the tech bust that may no longer be the case.
</p><p>The type of work and compensation varies dramatically with the types
of positions. Academic positions are tenure-track, research staff (non
tenured) and postdocs. Tenure-track positions at major universities are
fairly hard to come by; you need to be both good and lucky. Read the Feibelman
and Ralston references for more details. The tenure-track also requires
a lot of hours and dedication. As Randy Pausch put it, tenure is a competitive
process where you get compared with the other assistant professors and
the already-tenured professors. If they worked 70 hour weeks for six years
to get tenure, don't expect to get away with working 40 hour weeks. Postdocs
are low paying but good for padding your C.V. if you think you need it
to get a tenure track position. Just be sure to read the Feibelman reference,
which tells you exactly what you need to do to survive a postdoc. In general,
academic positions don't pay as well as industrial positions, but universities
offer more freedom, prestige, a richer intellectual environment and the
possibility of long-term stability (with tenure). There's a big difference
between startups, regular industrial jobs, and industrial research positions.
Startups can be the most lucrative financially, although that's a big gamble.
Read the Kawasaki and Bell references if you want to work at a startup.
Expect to put in long hours while losing contact with the research community.
Industrial research lies in an uncomfortable middle ground between production
jobs and academic research, and blends the advantages and disadvantages
of industry vs. academia.

<p>The above chart is from the March 2002 issue of Computing Research News.&nbsp;
It shows the results of the latest Taulbee survey of academic salaries,
where nine-month assistant professor salaries average in the $70-80k range.

<p>The above chart is from the November 2002 issue of Computing Research
News, showing compensation for industrial positions (based on 11 organizations
and 689 responses). Unsurprisingly, expected compensation from bonuses
and stock options dropped significantly from 2000 to 2001.&nbsp; Industrial
compensation is higher than academic, although the Taulbee figures are
for nine months of salary (not 12).&nbsp; With summer salary and other
supplements, the difference is reduced.&nbsp; Still, Computing Research
News estimates that total compensation for assistant and associate professors
lags that of comprable industrial counterparts by 25%.
</p><p>No matter where you go after you graduate, maintain your contacts with
your alma mater. You may change jobs and move from place to place, but
you will always have your degree from your university. If you keep good
relations with your university and your fellow former students, that will
serve as an excellent base for your personal network.

<b>Conclusion</b>
<ul><i>"Dissertations are not finished; they are abandoned."</i>
<br>- Fred Brooks
<p>The following story, called "The Parable of the Black Belt," is excerpted
from <i>Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies</i>, by
James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><ul>Picture a martial artist kneeling before the master sensei in a ceremony
to receive a hard-earned black belt. After years of relentless training,
the student has finally reached a pinnacle of achievement in the discipline.
<p>"Before granting the belt, you must pass one more test," says the sensei.
</p><p>"I am ready," responds the student, expecting perhaps one final round
of sparring.
</p><p>"You must answer the essential question: What is the true meaning of
the black belt?"
</p><p>"The end of my journey," says the student. "A well-deserved reward for
all my hard work."
</p><p>The sensei waits for more. Clearly, he is not satisfied. Finally, the
sensei speaks. "You are not yet ready for the black belt. Return in one
year."
</p><p>A year later, the student kneels again in front of the sensei.
</p><p>"What is the true meaning of the black belt?" asks the sensei.
</p><p>"A symbol of distinction and the highest achievement in our art," says
the student.
</p><p>The sensei says nothing for many minutes, waiting. Clearly, he is not
satisfied. Finally, he speaks. "You are still not ready for the black belt.
Return in one year."
</p><p>A year later, the student kneels once again in front of the sensei.
And again the sensei asks: "What is the true meaning of the black belt?"
</p><p>"The black belt represents the beginning -- the start of a never-ending
journey of discipline, work, and the pursuit of an ever-higher standard,"
says the student.
</p><p>"Yes. You are now ready to receive the black belt and <i>begin</i> your
work."
<br>&nbsp;</p></ul>
To me, there are two lessons in this story.
<p>First, the Ph.D. is the beginning, not the culmination, of your career.
Don't worry about making it your magnum opus. Get out sooner, rather than
later.
</p><p>Second, if you bother to talk to and learn from the people who have
already gone through this process, you might graduate two years earlier.
</p><p>Good luck.
