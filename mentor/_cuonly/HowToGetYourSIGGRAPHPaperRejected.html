<h1 align="center">How to Get Your SIGGRAPH Paper Rejected</h1>
<h3 align="center">Jim Kajiya, SIGGRAPH 93 Papers Chair</h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Everyone knows what acceptable SIGGRAPH papers look like: just look in
the proceedings.  When one only sees the accepted papers and not the
rejected ones, it is easy to get the wrong impression of what it is
that SIGGRAPH likes and doesn't like.
</p><p>
I've submitted a lot of papers that SIGGRAPH didn't like, as well as a
few they did.  Also, I've been on the papers committee a few times and
know what it is they look for.  This note tells you something about
what happens to your paper as it goes through the reviewing process as
well as what people discuss when they're trying to decide whether to
accept or reject your paper.  I'll try to tell you everything I've
learned about the SIGGRAPH secret: What SIGGRAPH wants, and how you
can give it to them so they'll accept your paper.  I'll also talk
about some of the flaws in the reviewing process and how you can
protect yourself against them.  Finally, I want to share some thoughts
on the present course and the future of technical papers for SIGGRAPH.
</p><p>
Before we do this, I would like to say why SIGGRAPH reviews are done
the way they are.  There are two reasons.
</p><p>
The first reason is the principal feature of the SIGGRAPH conference
publication that makes it very attractive: speed.  SIGGRAPH is one of
the few high-quality publications that can publish a paper in less
than a year.  In 10 weeks, SIGGRAPH can do what other major
publications take 10 months to do.  In a fast-moving field like
computer graphics, this is crucial.
</p><p>
The second reason is that SIGGRAPH has chosen a very different quality
strategy than most other conferences.  While other conferences will
accept papers of incomplete work in progress, SIGGRAPH has chosen to
shoot for the highest quality papers of complete results.  Because of
this, 80% of submitted papers are rejected.  The MacArthur Foundation
is more generous with its "genius" awards than SIGGRAPH is with its
papers.  There are more MacArthur awards each year than SIGGRAPH
technical papers.
</p><p>
The emphasis on both speed and quality makes the reviewing process for
SIGGRAPH very different from of a journal or another conference.  The
speed and quality emphasis also puts severe strains on the reviewing
process.  In a journal, the reviewer and authors can have a dialog
where shortcomings and misunderstandings can be resolved over a
leisurely pace.  Also, even if there are significant flaws in a paper
for another conference, the chances are that strengths will overcome
the weaknesses in the judging.  In SIGGRAPH, if the reviewers
misunderstand your paper, or if some flaw in your paper is found,
you're dead.
</p><p>
The reviewing process for SIGGRAPH is far from perfect, although most
everyone is giving it their best effort.  The very nature of the
process is such that many reviewers will not be able to spend nearly
enough time weighing the nuances of your paper.  This is something for
which you must compensate in order to be successful.  But I'll get to
that later.  First, let's talk about what happens to your paper.
</p>

<h2>The Reviewing Process</h2>
<p>
How does your paper get accepted or rejected by SIGGRAPH?  Let's
follow it through the entire process.
</p><p>
First, you work for months, slaving away at equations, hacking code,
and feeding slides to your local photofinisher.  SIGGRAPH fever rises
to absurd heights at the last week: "Let's see I only have 105 hours
until the deadline...".  You put everything together, accomplishing
superhuman tasks to make the Federal Express deadline at the very last
minute.  Your six copies are taken by the courier safely to the papers
chair, then you-and everyone around you-collapse.
</p><p>
The next day, as you and hundreds of other morlocks around the world
come out of sub-basements to blink at the first natural sunlight
you've seen in weeks, is deadline day.  Fully 85% of the 200 or so
SIGGRAPH submissions arrive at the papers chair doorstep.  Everyone
else has worked until the last possible minute, too.  The papers chair
and several dedicated assistants then spend their long all-nighter
giving your paper a number, entering it into the database, and typing
and mailing a letter acknowledging receipt of your paper.
</p><p>
Immediately after this, the papers chair, along with two or three
others on the papers committee, sorts through all the papers and
assigns your paper to the pile for a particular senior reviewer.  The
papers program committee is made up of 25 or so of these senior
reviewers.  With the large number of papers, this partitioning process
takes a full day.
</p><p>
One copy of your paper is retained by the papers chair.  One copy is
mailed to the secondary reviewer, and four copies are mailed to the
senior reviewer.  Thus each reviewer receives a large Federal Express
box of your papers and video tapes.  This usually happens a week after
the deadline.
</p><p>
The senior reviewers receive a set of 14-18 papers.  For half of these
they act as secondary reviewer and for half as senior reviewer.  As
senior reviewers, they look at your paper and choose three additional
reviewers-at least two of whom are external to his or her institution.
The senior reviewer sends a list of these reviewers to the chair
within two weeks.
</p><p>
The reviewers then each receive a copy of your paper, slides, and
video.  The reviewer reads your paper, evaluates it, and fills out the
review form that eventually makes its way back to you.  He or she may
fill out the hard copy or may email the review back to the senior
reviewer.  The reviewer has four weeks to do this.
</p><p>
After the senior reviewer gets each review of your paper, a review
summary is made and a score is computed.  Copies are made of the
summaries and reviews.  The originals are then Federal Expressed to
the chair.
</p><p>
The chair tabulates all the scores, sorts your paper according to
score, records it in a database, and prints out a set of custom lists
for each senior reviewer summarizing all the papers.
</p><p>
The following week, the paper selection meeting occurs.  This meeting,
where the fate of your paper is determined, lasts for two full days.
If your paper is on the very bottom or very top of the list, very
little discussion is given to your paper (unless the senior reviewer
wants a short discussion by full committee).  This no-discussion
acceptance/rejection eats away at the top and bottom of the list until
the density of discussion slows the process.
</p><p>
Then a "triage" session occurs.  During this time, the senior and
secondary reviewers, as well as others who might share expertise in
the subject area, discuss your paper.  They then decide to accept,
reject, or discuss your paper.  If they decide to accept or reject,
your paper will receive a short summary in full committee session.
But let's say they opt for discussion.
</p><p>
Toward the latter part of the first day, the triage session is over
and the real work begins.  About 60% of the papers could not be judged
easily one way or the other.  Yours is among them.  So the entire
committee discusses each paper and decides its fate.  Often the
discussion is postponed while more people read your paper and discuss
it with the other senior reviewers.  These papers are then discussed,
often over dinner.
</p><p>
The second day is taken up with full committee discussions of your
paper.  I've been in sessions when some papers have been discussed and
then postponed and then discussed again for five or six times.
There's a lot of argument, some shouting, photos are passed around,
and the slides are peered at.  Usually the videotapes are viewed
during the breaks. For difficult cases, summary letters are written to
you that described the final opinion of the committee.  At the end of
the day, consensus has been achieved on all submissions, and your
paper is either accepted or rejected.
</p><p>
After that, the disposition of each paper is double checked by the
entire committee.  All materials that go back to you are collected,
and all copies to be destroyed are collected.  People say good bye and
rush off to the airport.  Some stay to help the chair to group
accepted papers into sessions for the conference, try to make up some
sort of silly theme for each session, and to assign session chairs
among the senior reviewers.
</p><p>
The chair then takes the database and generates acceptance or
rejection letters and packages it up with any additional material to
be sent back to you.  You find out whether your paper was accepted or
not in about 10 weeks' time.
</p><p>
If all this sounds like a scheme to exercise Federal Express, you're
right.  SIGGRAPH's Federal Express bills for this process run over
$3,000.  That doesn't count your Federal Express bill, which in toto
probably matches this.
</p>
<h2>The SIGGRAPH Secret</h2>
<p>
Just what is it they are discussing about your paper?  Why are they 
shouting?
</p><p>
The SIGGRAPH paper selection meeting is an intense experience that
only a few dozen people have ever encountered.  It is not coincidental
that the same people who sit on the selection committee will author
many papers that appear in SIGGRAPH year after year.  This is not
because they're part of the "in" crowd whose papers are given
favorable treatment-I haven't seen anything like that the times I've
been on the committee.  There are two real reasons.  The first is that
the program committee members are all accomplished authorities in
their respective fields-they tend to do good stuff.  The second
reason, though, is due to their experience as a papers committee
member.  In this, they do have an advantage over you, an ordinary
author, who hasn't been among the chosen few.
</p><p>
The advantage these people have is that they know what it takes to get
a SIGGRAPH paper accepted.  They know what the reviewers like and
don't like.  They know what kinds of things get discussed in the
selection meeting.  In short, they know the secret of what SIGGRAPH is
looking for.
</p>
<h2>Review Criteria</h2>
<p>
What the technical program committee talks about when they consider
your paper in their secret discussion is not really complicated.  They
discuss the questions in the review form you receive back with your
paper.
</p><p>
They discuss what the reviewers said in their answers and whether they
believed the reviewers.  They talk about their personal answers to the
review form questions concerning your paper.  They sometimes are
absolutely positive, or other times may admit they're unsure.  Often
times they want other committee members to read your paper and form an
opinion.  Several people who are intrigued may volunteer and enter
into a small separate discussion on the various points in your paper.
</p><p>
The questions on the review form change slightly from year to year,
but the basic thrust remains the same.  If you know the questions
asked on this form, you'll be able to predict what the discussion
topics will be in the committee meeting.  Let's look at the questions
and see what kind of discussion goes with each.
</p>
<dl><dt>1. Briefly summarize the paper.
</dt><dd>
<p>
This question really is a sanity check to make sure the reviewer
understood the paper.  The most dangerous mistake you can make when
writing your paper is assuming that the reviewer will understand the
point of your paper.  The complaint is often heard that the reviewer
did not understand what an author was trying to say.  Remember,
SIGGRAPH operates under the twin constraints of speed and quality.  If
you have quality, but it can't be recognized by reviewers who are in a
hurry, you'll get rejected.
</p>

</dd><dt>2. What does this paper contribute to computer graphics?
</dt><dd>
<p>
This question often generates the most discussion.  Is your paper a
pioneering new direction?  Or is it just a small delta over previous
work?  The collective memory and knowledge of the papers committee is
truly awesome.  Obscure work that has appeared in a seemingly
unrelated journal, or work embodied in some commercial product is at
the collective fingertips of the committee.  Nearly any facet of
computer graphics, no matter how small, seems to be known by someone
on the committee.  Thus, your work is judged against a very rich
context and history.
</p><p>
Your paper will get rejected unless you make it very clear, up front,
what you think your paper has contributed.  If you don't explicitly
state the problem you're solving, the context of your problem and
solution, and how your paper differs (and improves upon) previous
work, you're trusting that the reviewers will figure it out. Don't try
to make the reviewers dig it out from inside your paper.  Maybe they
will, or maybe they won't.
</p>

</dd><dt>3. Is the paper stimulating?
</dt><dd>
<p>
Is your paper likely to create a new direction for research in
computer graphics?  Are people going to read your paper and want to
extend your ideas?  Are they going to read your system paper and say
"Yes! I've been wanting to implement something like this, and now I
know how."  Is your application paper going to make people talk about
your great new way to use computer graphics?  Will your algorithm be
implemented by dozens of people to become a standard widget in the
graphics toolkit?  Or is your paper a dead end?  Is it just going to
take up pages in SIGGRAPH, not be read or referenced, just drop out of
sight?
</p><p>
Again, stating the problem and its context is important.  But what you
want to do here is to state the "implications" of your solution.  Sure
it's obvious....to you.  But you run the risk of misunderstanding and
rejection if you don't spell it out explicitly in your introduction.
</p>

</dd><dt>4. Is the paper of interest to the SIGGRAPH audience?
</dt><dd>
<p>
Does your paper solve a long-standing problem that people want to know
how to solve?  Is your system or application interesting to a wide
swath of the audience?  Or is your paper so narrow that only ten
people at the conference will care about it? When you speak will the
auditorium be packed, or will everyone leave?
</p><p>
Well, to get rejected, pick a subject no one cares about.  But, if
your subject has less than obvious application to a wide range of
graphics problems, you'd better figure out how to say it convincingly
in your introduction.
</p>

</dd><dt>5. Is the paper well written?
</dt><dd>
<p>
Your ideas may be great, the problem of burning interest to a lot of
people, but your paper might be so poorly written that no one could
figure out what you were saying.  If English isn't your native tongue,
you should be especially sensitive to this issue.  Many otherwise good
papers have floundered on an atrocious text. If you have a planned
organization for your discussion and you not only stick to it, but
tell your readers over and over where you are in that organization,
you'll have a well written paper.  Really, you don't have to have a
literary masterpiece with sparkling prose.
</p>

</dd><dt>6. Can an experienced practitioner in the field duplicate the 
    results from the paper and the references?
</dt><dd>
<p>
This question often gets people shouting in the committee meeting.
Basically the question is about completeness.  Your paper may be doing
something very interesting, of obvious importance to graphics.  But
your paper leaves something out.  Your description of what you're
doing is so sketchy and abbreviated that no one will be able to do the
same thing.  The key purpose of a technical or scientific paper is
that it contains enough information so that an experienced
practitioner, say, a graduate student in graphics, can reproduce the
experiment.  If you've not explained enough about how you do
things-even if you think it's just obvious-then it's quite likely your
paper will be rejected.
</p>


</dd><dt>7. Should we accept this paper for SIGGRAPH 93?  Why?
</dt><dd>
<p>
This last question is the final recommendation about acceptance.  This
recommendation is tabulated to make a score for your paper that
determines where in the sorted list your paper will find itself.  I
used to think that if just one reviewer didn't like the paper, you'd
be dead.  But since I've been on the committee I've found that that's
not true at all. I've seen some rejected papers that have had four
"accept" recommendations and one "maybe."  This is because the
committee doesn't blindly follow the scores at all.  They really
discuss the merits of each paper. A paper might be a solid technical
paper, written by well-known names, but it might be boring.  It might
be just so small an advance over existing techniques that it's not
very exciting. The committee has a detailed discussion trying to
isolate a new twist in the paper.  The discussion goes back and forth
about whether the new twist is obvious or not.  Even though it gets
favorable reviews, the committee decides to reject.
</p><p>
On the other hand, a paper might have a really neat new idea. That
idea may open up a whole new line of work.  But the paper is badly
written, and it doesn't really explain things enough so that someone
without a Ph.D. in mathematical physics would be able to do anything
with it.  Because of this, all the reviews are bad.  Someone says that
one of the authors is a responsible person and will probably rewrite
the paper into something decent.  Someone else says that there's no
guarantee that anything at all will be changed, then the proceedings
will have this horrible paper in it: why not reject and wait till next
year?  Finally the committee votes, it passes by a narrow margin.
Thus the committee has decided to gamble on the authors to fix the
problems once they're pointed out.  Sometimes the gamble pays off;
sometimes it doesn't.
</p><p>
All this brings up a phenomenon that happens inside the paper
selection meeting.  Often a committee member may take up the cause of
getting your paper "in" and argue for acceptance of your paper.  Tom
Sederberg, the SIGGRAPH 91 chair, has called the people who can ferret
out the good features of your paper "paper champions."  On the other
hand, there may be a committee member who is very articulate,
forceful, and negative, who argues against your paper.  They look for
and find flaws in your paper, they sway the committee to reject your
paper.  Ed Catmull, the SIGGRAPH 92 chair, has called these people
"paper killers."
</p><p>
One job of the papers chair is to see that the committee is staffed
with people who are paper champions. We want to avoid paper killers.
</p></dd></dl>
<p></p><p>
So that's it.  That's what goes on in the discussion.  I must admit
that as a paper author I've been guilty of screwing up on almost all
the points mentioned in the review criteria.  My long string of paper
rejects have been due to repeated deficiencies in not stating the
problem or its context, not explaining why the subject is interesting,
writing disorganized papers, and leaving out key points that I thought
were obvious.  And just writing stuff that was plain hard to read, so
that some of the reviewers just missed my point.
</p>
<h2>Mistakes</h2>
<p>
The characteristics that make SIGGRAPH so attractive - speed and high
quality - also make SIGGRAPH an imperfect vehicle for technical
dissemination of graphics ideas.  The review process is far from
perfect.  The chair needs to get your paper quickly distributed.  The
first mistakes are made right there: among the 200 or so papers, some
are just sent to the wrong senior reviewer.  The senior reviewer may
not carefully read your paper and ask the wrong people to review it.
Those people may not read your paper carefully, they misunderstand it.
Finally, you may have your paper attacked by a paper killer that the
chair mistakenly appointed.
</p><p>
How can you protect yourself against these mistakes?  You must make
your paper easy to read.  You've got to make it easy for anyone to
tell what your paper is about, what problem it solves, why the problem
is interesting, what is really new in your paper (and what isn't), why
it's so neat. And you must do it up front.  In other words, you must
write a dynamite introduction.  In your introduction you can address
most of the points we talked about in the last section.  If you do it
clearly and succinctly, you set the proper context for understanding
the rest of your paper.  Only then should you go about describing what
you've done.
</p><p>
Another point is why rendering papers have an advantage in SIGGRAPH.
If you have good-looking pictures, you've got your foot in the door.
SIGGRAPH reviewers are like everyone else.  They first look at the
pictures in your paper.  If your pictures are really good looking,
they're going to go to some effort to find out how you did them.
</p><p>
You can use those pictures in another way. Ivan Sutherland once told
me that Scientific American articles are constructed so that you can
get the point of the article just by reading the captions to the
illustrations.  Now, I'm not suggesting that you write a technical
comic book; but you should take a look at those SIGGRAPH papers you
were initially attracted to and see how they went about getting their
point across.
</p><p>
Unless you write about a very limited subject, or unless your results
are technically incorrect, rejection has very little to do with the
subject of your paper.  It has a great deal to do with how you wrote
your paper.  After all, if everyone misunderstood your paper, you
might consider that it might not be quite as clear as you thought.
Reviewers are in a hurry: you have to get your paper just right or you
will suffer rejection.  Rejection doesn't come from the subject area,
it really just comes from an imperfect understanding on both sides.
</p><p>
But on the whole, it's a very noisy process.  The SIGGRAPH review is
done quickly, by the best people the chair knows, and by the best
people they know, with everyone earnestly committed to put out the
highest quality proceedings possible.  Mistakes are sometimes made.
</p>
<h2>What SIGGRAPH Wants...</h2>
<p>
There seems to be a number of prevalent myths and misunderstandings
about what it is that SIGGRAPH wants and doesn't want for its papers.
Each year, the papers that appear in the proceedings appear to be more
and more technical, about narrower and narrower areas.  I've spoken
with many people who've been concerned about the path that the papers
sessions for SIGGRAPH have taken.
</p><p>
I fear that this trend is all too real.  I'm very worried about it.  I
believe that the papers sessions at SIGGRAPH are in trouble.  Only
about 10% of the technical program registrants go to the papers
sessions.  Sometimes fewer than 200 people are in attendance at a
paper session.  This tells me that very few people find the SIGGRAPH
papers interesting anymore.
</p><p>
For some years, people thought of the papers sessions as almost
exclusively about rendering - SIGGRAPH as "SIGRay" or "SIGRadiosity."
Or people have viewed the papers sessions as valid only for those
papers that have been about "pure" graphics.  Almost everyone agrees
that the papers are the exclusive domain of the academics, exploring
esoteric and obscure corners of graphics.
</p><p>
I believe that the reason for this alarming narrowing of SIGGRAPH
papers is a dangerous positive feedback loop. You see, people can't
see what papers are rejected.  They can only see the papers that are
accepted.  Thus when you look at a proceedings you see a certain set
of papers and you say, "Ahh,...THAT'S the kind of thing that SIGGRAPH
wants."  So, if you have an idea for a paper that isn't like the kind
that have been appearing in SIGGRAPH for the last ten years or so, you
wouldn't send it in to SIGGRAPH.  You say, THIS is not really what
they want at SIGGRAPH anymore, they want THAT.  If you are brave, do
submit to SIGGRAPH, and your paper becomes a casualty of the 80%
rejection rate, you feel that SIGGRAPH really doesn't want your type
of paper anymore.  Thus you don't send anything in to SIGGRAPH about
that subject again.
</p><p>
Well, the papers committee and the papers chair don't really determine
what SIGGRAPH publishes.  The authors who brave the SIGGRAPH review
process are the real controllers of what appears in SIGGRAPH. The
committee can only select among the papers that are submitted.
Consider this: if there are 150 rendering papers submitted, only two
systems papers, one interactive techniques paper, and no applications
papers submitted, what will the proceedings look like?  Then everyone
will say, "See, SIGGRAPH only wants rendering."  But what really
happened is that SIGGRAPH "rejected" 127 rendering papers, and
rejected only one systems paper, and didn't reject a single
application paper!
</p>
<h2>How Can Papers Sessions Be Fixed?</h2>
<p>
Is there a way to make a kinder, gentler SIGGRAPH?  Can something be
done about the 80% rejection rate?  Actually, something has been done
about it.  Several years ago, there was an institutional constraint on
the papers session and proceedings to fit in a single track.  Because
of this, there was a limit on the maximum number of SIGGRAPH papers
that would be accepted, no matter how many good papers there were.
During those years, one thing that was watched very closely was the
number of papers that were accepted as the paper selection meeting
progressed.  As the limit was approached, people tended to get a bit
more critical of flaws in the paper under discussion.  Almost as a
confirmation of the policy, the limit was never reached.  Meanwhile,
the number of SIGGRAPH submissions (and rejections) steadily
increased.  Today, that constraint has been lifted.  There is no
longer any limit on the number of papers allowed.  And pleasantly, I
found that during the last meeting, concern about the number of
accepted papers was not a big issue.  In SIGGRAPH '92, no parallel
sessions happened to be required.  We're still under the old limit.
But now, the number of papers accepted is solely determined by the big
issue.  The big issue, of course, is "Is it above the [quality]
threshold?"
</p><p>
It is foolish to capriciously tinker with the speed and the quality of
SIGGRAPH in the hopes one might fix the serious positive feedback
focus problem.  Frankly, I'm afraid to make big, sweeping changes in a
process that works well a lot of the time.  However, you'll note that
this year there is a new class of papers: long papers.  Only systems
and applications category papers will be admitted in the long class.
Andy van Dam has pointed out that the page limit for regular papers
favors research papers.  A research paper can usually state the
problem, its context, and the solution in a short space.  A system
paper needs more pages to do this and it must also describe the
experience that the builders have had with the system.  Eight pages
was just not enough room to write a decent system or application
paper.
</p><p>
The root cause of the positive feedback loop, however, remains.  It is
self-censure.  People just won't send in papers on subjects they
think SIGGRAPH doesn't want.  I can understand this: even after all my
SIGGRAPH rejections, it still hurts.
</p><p>
The entire reason I've written this document is to try to break the
loop.  I want to communicate to you, and I want you to communicate to
your colleagues, that SIGGRAPH is in the business of publishing good
technical work in graphics of "all" flavors.
</p><p>
SIGGRAPH really does want papers about user interfaces, visualization,
graphics hardware, graphics software systems, interactive techniques,
displays, innovative applications, video games, combined graphics and
sound, hypermedia, virtual reality, typesetting, color, paint systems,
image and video compression, image and video processing, and how to
make pictures that aren't just pretty but say something too.
</p><p>
Sure it's true that they've rejected papers in all these areas over
and over again.  But, it's also true that they've rejected 10 times as
many papers on ray tracing. The narrowness of the technical focus of
the papers can be fixed only if you and your colleagues send in
quality papers about a wider range of subjects.  My earnest hope is
that the SIGGRAPH 93 technical papers program will not just be about
modeling, rendering, and animation.
