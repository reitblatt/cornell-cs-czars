<H1>Writing a good grant proposal </H1>
Simon Peyton Jones and Alan Bundy
</center>
<p>
Writing a good research grant proposal is 
not easy. This document is an attempt to collect together a number of 
suggestions about what makes a good proposal. It is inevitably a personal view 
on the part of the authors; we would welcome feedback and suggestions from 
others. 
<H2>APPROACHING A PROPOSAL </H2>The first and most obvious thing to do is to 
read the advice offered by your funding agency. In the case of EPSRC, the 
primary funding body for computing science research, there is a "Guide to EPSRC 
Research Grants". We make no attempt to duplicate the material in the EPSRC 
guide or any other; you must get yourself a copy and follow the guidance 
closely. 
<P>The most substantial part of any grant application is some form of "Case for 
Support". It is this case which will persuade, or fail to persuade, your funding 
body of the value of your proposal. Proposals range very widely indeed in their 
quality. You can improve your chances enormously simply by ruthlessly writing 
and rewriting. This document is entirely about improving your case for support. 
<P>There are two vital facts to bear in mind: 
<UL>
  <LI>Your case for support will, with luck, be read by one or two experts in 
  your field. But the programme manager, and most members of the panel that 
  judges your proposal against others, won't be expert. You must, must, must 
  write your proposal for their benefit too. 
<p>
  <LI>Remember that programme managers and panel members see tens or hundreds of 
  cases for support, so you have one minute or less to grab your reader's 
  attention. </LI></UL>Based on these facts, here are two Golden Rules: 
<UL>
  <LI><EM>Ask lots of people to help you improve your proposal</EM>. Give it to 
  your colleagues, your friends, your spouse, your dog, and listen to what they 
  say. If they misunderstand what you were trying to say, don't say "you 
  misunderstood me"; instead rewrite it so it can't be misunderstood. If they 
  don't immediately see the value of what you want to achieve, rewrite it until 
  they do. And so on. 
  <P>This isn't a big demand to make on someone. Ask them to read your proposal 
  for 10 minutes, and say what they think. Remember, most committee members will 
  give it less time than that. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Make sure that the first page acts as a stand-alone summary of the 
  entire proposal.</EM> Assume (it's a safe assumption) that many readers will 
  get no further than the first page. So don't fill it up with boilerplate about 
  the technical background. Instead, present your whole case: what you want to 
  do, why it's important, why you will succeed, how much it will cost, and so 
  on. </LI></UL>
<H2>CRITERIA FOR A GOOD GRANT PROPOSAL </H2>Most funding agencies apply similar 
criteria to the evaluation of proposals. We discuss these below. It is important 
to address these criteria directly in your case for support. A proposal which 
fails to meet them will be rejected regardless of the quality of its source. 
Otherwise, there is a danger of discriminating unfairly in favour of well-known 
applicants. 
<H3>Major criteria </H3>Here are the major criteria against which your proposal 
will be judged. Read through your case for support repeatedly, and ask whether 
the answers to the questions below are clear, even to a non-expert. 
<UL>
  <LI><EM>Does the proposal address a well-formulated problem</EM>? 
<p>
  <LI><EM>Is it a research problem</EM>, or is it just a routine application of 
  known techniques? 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Is it an important problem, whose solution will have useful 
  effects?</EM> 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Is special funding necessary to solve the problem, or to solve it 
  quickly enough</EM>, or could it be solved using the normal resources of a 
  well-found laboratory? 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Do the proposers have a good idea on which to base their work?</EM> 
  The proposal must explain the idea in sufficient detail to convince the reader 
  that the idea has some substance, and should explain why there is reason to 
  believe that it is indeed a good idea. It is absolutely not enough merely to 
  identify a wish-list of desirable goals (a very common fault). There must be 
  significant technical substance to the proposal. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Does the proposal explain clearly what work will be done?</EM> Does it 
  explain what results are expected and how they will be evaluated? How would it 
  be possible to judge whether the work was successful? 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Is there evidence that the proposers know about the work that others 
  have done on the problem?</EM> This evidence may take the form of a short 
  review as well as representative references. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Do the proposers have a good track record, both of doing good research 
  and of publishing it?</EM> A representative selection of relevant publications 
  by the proposers should be cited. Absence of a track record is clearly not a 
  disqualifying characteristic, especially in the case of young researchers, but 
  a consistent failure to publish raises question marks. </LI></UL>
<H3>Secondary criteria </H3>Some secondary criteria may be applied to separate 
closely-matched proposals. It is often essentially impossible to distinguish in 
a truly objective manner among such proposals and it is sad that it is necessary 
to do so. The criteria are ambiguous and conflict with each other, so the 
committee simply has to use its best judgement in making its recommendations. 
<UL>
  <LI>An applicant with little existing funding may deserve to be placed ahead 
  of a well- funded one. On the other hand, existing funding provides evidence 
  of a good track record. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>There is merit in funding a proposal to keep a strong research team 
  together; but it is also important to give priority to new researchers in the 
  field. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>An attempt is made to maintain a reasonable balance between different 
  research areas, where this is possible. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Evidence of industrial interest in a proposal, and of its potential for 
  future exploitation will usually count in its favour. The closer the research 
  is to producing a product the more industrial involvement is required and this 
  should usually include some industrial contribution to the project. The case 
  for support should include some `route to market' plan, ie you should have 
  thought about how the research will eventually become a product --- 
  identifying an industrial partner is usually part of such a plan. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>A proposal will benefit if it is seen to address recommendations of 
  Technology Foresight. It is worth looking at the relevant Foresight Panel 
  reports and including quotes in your case for support that relate to your 
  proposal. </LI></UL>
<H3>Cost-effectiveness </H3>Finally, the programme manager tries to ensure that 
his or her budget is to be used in a cost-effective manner. Each proposal which 
has some chance of being funded is examined, and the programme manager may lop 
costs off an apparently over-expensive project.Such cost reduction is likely to 
happen if the major costs of staff and equipment are not given clear, individual 
justification. 
<H2>COMMON SHORTCOMINGS </H2>Here are some of the ways in which proposals often 
fail to meet these criteria. 
<UL>
  <LI><EM>It is not clear what question is being addressed by the proposal</EM>. 
  In particular, it is not clear what the outcome of the research might be, or 
  what would constitute success or failure. It is vital to discuss what 
  contribution to human knowledge would be made by the research. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The question being addressed is woolly or ill-formed</EM>. The 
  committee are looking for evidence of clear thinking both in the formulation 
  of the problem and in the planned attack on it. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>It is not clear why the question is worth addressing</EM>. The 
  proposal must be well motivated. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposal is just a routine application of known techniques</EM>. 
  Research funding agencies are interested in funding research rather than 
  development. Industry are expected to fund development work. The LINK scheme 
  is appropriate for proposals which combine both research and development. If 
  the development would benefit another research field, rather than industry, 
  then look to the funding agencies of that field. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Industry ought to be doing it instead</EM>. If the work is `near 
  market' then it should be done by industry or industry or venture capital 
  should be funding you to do it. If no industry is interested then the prima 
  facie assumption is that the product has no commercial value. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>There is no evidence that the proposers will succeed where others have 
  failed</EM>. It is easy enough to write a proposal with an exciting-sounding 
  wish-list of hoped-for achievements, but you must substantiate your goals with 
  solid evidence of why you have a good chance of achieving them. 
  <P>This evidence generally takes two main forms: 
  <UL>
    <P>
    <LI>"We have an idea". In this case, you should sketch the idea, and 
    describe preliminary work you have done which shows that it is indeed a good 
    idea. You are unlikely to get funding without such evidence. It is not good 
    saying "give us the money and we will start thinking about this problem". 
    <P></P>
    <LI>"We have a good track record". Include a selective list of publications, 
    and perhaps include a short paper (preferably a published one) which gives 
    more background, as an appendix. If you make it clear that it is an 
    appendix, you won't usually fall foul of any length limits. </LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>A new idea is claimed but insufficient technical details of the idea 
  are given for the committee to be able to judge whether it looks 
  promising</EM>. Since the committee cannot be expert in all areas there is a 
  danger of overwhelming them with technical details, but it is better to err by 
  overwhelming them than by underwhelming them. They will usually get an expert 
  referee to evaluate your idea. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposers seem unaware of related research</EM>. Related work must 
  be mentioned, if only to be dismissed. Otherwise, the committee will think 
  that the proposers are ignorant and, therefore, not the best group to fund. 
  The case for support should have a list of references like any paper, and you 
  should look at it to check it has a balanced feel - your referee will do so. 
  Do not make the mistake of giving references only to your own work! 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposed research has already been done - or appears to have been 
  done</EM>. Rival solutions must be discussed and their inadequacies revealed. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposal is badly presented, or incomprehensible to all but an 
  expert in the field</EM>. Remember that your proposal will be read by 
  non-experts as well as (hopefully) experts. A good proposal is simultaneously 
  comprehensible to non-experts, while also convincing experts that you know 
  your subject. Keep highly-technical material in well-signposted section(s); 
  avoid it in the introduction. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposers seem to be attempting too much for the funding requested 
  and time-scale envisaged</EM>. Such lack of realism may reflect a poor 
  understanding of the problem or poor research methodology. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposal is too expensive for the probable gain</EM>. If it is 
  easy to see how to cut the request for people/equipment/travel, etc. to 
  something more reasonable then it might be awarded in reduced form. More 
  likely, it will be rejected. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposers institution should be funding it</EM>. Research agencies 
  will usually only fund research that requires resources beyond that which 
  might be expected in a "well-found laboratory" --- indeed, this is part of the 
  charter of the research councils. If it looks like your proposal might be done 
  by a PhD student on the departmental computer then that is what should happen. 
  If the proposer's laboratory is not "well-found" then this is taken to be a 
  vote of no-confidence in the proposer by his/her institution. 
</LI></UL>Doubtless there are other common grounds for failure that have been 
omitted. If you know of any please let us know!. 
<P>Often, one can tell from independent knowledge of the proposers or by reading 
between the lines of the proposal, that the criteria could have been met if a 
little bit more thought had gone into the proposal. There is a clear question 
being addressed by the research, but the proposers failed to clarify what it 
was. The proposers are aware of related research, but they failed to discuss it 
in the proposal. The proposers do have some clear technical ideas, but they 
thought it inappropriate to go into such detail in the proposal. Unfortunately, 
there is a limit to which a funding agencies can give such cases the benefit of 
the doubt. It is not fair for referees to overlook shortcomings in proposals of 
which they have personal knowledge if similar shortcomings are not overlooked in 
proposals which they have not encountered before. In any case, proposals which 
<EM>do</EM> meet the criteria deserve precedence. 
<H2>CONCLUSION </H2>We hope that this document will help you to write better 
grant proposals, and hence to be more successful in obtaining funds for your 
research. This article is not just about writing better grant proposals to 
obtain more money. The basic set-up of peer-reviewed grants of limited duration 
is a sensible one. It compels researchers regularly to review and re-justify the 
direction of their work. Behind poorly presented grant proposals often lie 
poorly-reasoned research plans. Perhaps if we can improve the quality of 
Computer Science proposals we will also improve the quality of Computer Science 
research.
