<h1>Some thoughts about graduate school </h1>
<p><i>Advice from  <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru">Andrew C. Myers</a> to his research group, December 2007.</i></p>

<p>Some things for graduate students to think about:
<ol>
<li> Aim to be an author on at least one publishable paper per year.
   It can be a collaboration with other students, and it can be a workshop,
   not a first-rate conference. But you should figure out how to package up
   what you have been doing in a way that makes it useful for others to read
   about.
</li>

<li> Block out some time every day to do thinking about research. If you are
   writing a thesis, block out time to do writing. Figure out at what time
   of day you are most productive and allocate that time to the activity
   requiring the most focus and creativity.
</li>

<li> It's important to read lots of papers. To get a Ph.D. you will need to
   be expert in some subarea, which means that you can identify nearly
   every relevant paper in that area and discuss it intelligently. Try to read
   at least one paper a week that is relevant to your research interests.
   There are many ways to identify papers to read, e.g.: following references
   from papers you have read already, Googling for topics, asking others about
   interesting papers.
</li>

<li> Graduate school can feel kind of relaxed, with few formal deadlines and
   not too much supervision (or money!). Don't be fooled. Time is still
   precious.
</li>

<li> Be visible. Interact with other students and faculty.  Don't be afraid
   to work with other students. Talk to people about what you are working on.
   Be enthusiastic about what you are doing, but also listen to their
   feedback, which can help you refine your research and your story about it.
</li>
</ol>
